    "   Sitcoms have always been a staple of cable television. Over the years, audiences all over the nation have witnessed major networks debut hundreds of different sitcom pilots in an attempt to create the next \"Seinfeld\" or \"Friends\". So what makes certain sitcoms reach \"water cooler conversation\" status while others vanish just as fast as they came into existance? \n",
    "\n",
    "   Sometimes, the reason why a show fails is clear. Maybe a lead actor on the program got caught in a PR scandal or perhaps network budget cuts lead to an early cancellation. Personally, I believe that the key to a show's success is in the script. For this project, I decided to try to answer the question **Is there a relationship between a sitcom's script and the success it has?** and see what other information that I could uncover while analyzing television sitcom script data."

    "I've always had an appreciation for television and movie scripts and I wanted to incorporate them into my Capstone project somehow. While I tend to prefer dramatic television over sitcoms when praising tv, I can't deny the comfort that an old sitcom provides me. Of course, while my adoration of well-written television spans many levels, the real reasons that I chose to focus on sitcoms are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) I chose sitcoms because their scripts are short (as the episodes tend to span just over 20 minutes) and I knew that it would be less time-consuming to model on shorter scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Additionally, sitcoms are historically both simple and formulaic. This means that trends are likely to be easier to identify and replicate than in more complex dramatic shows such as Breaking Bad. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.) And finally, with The Big Bang Theory airing its thirteenth and final season this year - after beating out television-giant Game of Thrones for the most watched series finale in 2019 - it looks like the sitcom game is about to open up and pick a new MVP. In my mind, this creates a demand for a project like this."

    "I was unable to find an adequate dataset of television sitcom scripts online, so I ended up sourcing my own data for this project. To answer my questions about the relationship between a sitcom's script and its success, I decided to compile a dataframe of roughly 50 different sitcoms. About half of the sitcoms failed and half of the sitcoms were successful, as defined by the criteria listed in the section below. For each program, I included several data points that I thought could be relevant to my research; such as the year the show first debuted, the network it debuted on, a summary of the premise, etc. Most importantly, I also included a link to the script of the pilot episode of each show. I then used the web-scraping API Selenium to retrieve the pilot scripts from the web into my dataframe."

    "Television series in my successful set each had a score of 7 or higher on IMDB, a score of 60% or higher on Rotten Tomatoes, and had at least 3 seasons (with the exception of Atlanta, which had 2 seasons at the time of data collection, but had already been renewed for both a 3rd and 4th season).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create as much evenness among the data as well as control for as many confounding variables as possible, all television programs aired on major cable television networks, were American-made and were created in the last 30 years. This criteria meant excluding all of the successful and unsuccessful content released by Netflix, HBO, or other platforms of the like as well as excluding several sitcom giants, such as 'Cheers' and 'I Love Lucy'. Each show also fits into the genre of \"situational comedy\" and has an average episode duration of 22-minutes."

Our numerical columns are all correctly encoded as integers or floats except for our last column, \"viewfinale\" (which measures the number of viewers that tuned into the series finale), which is encoded as an object. This is probably because while collecting data for viewfinale, a couple of the successful shows in my dataframe hadn't aired their series finale yet, so instead of leaving the cell blank, I wrote in \"TBD\" and figured I would deal with it later. I may replace all the \"TBD\"s with zeros later, but I'm not sure if I will use that column in my EDA so for now I will let it be."

For instance, while I was gathering data for failed pilots, I saw that a decent amount of the failed sitcoms were pulled before all of their episodes had aired. I wanted to keep track of this to see if there was a pattern among my data between shows pulled early and especially low IMDB scores or something of the like. Additionally, if and when I revisit this data someday, maybe I will make a variable for \"pulled_early\".\n",
