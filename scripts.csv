430,fail,How to Be a Gentleman,Her words.
431,fail,How to Be a Gentleman,Maybe that's exactly what she wants.
432,fail,How to Be a Gentleman,Maybe this is all about trying to get a rise out of you.
433,fail,How to Be a Gentleman,"Look, Mike, life is a big bully, and it punches you in the face over and over again unless you punch back."
434,fail,How to Be a Gentleman,You're right.

450,fail,How to Be a Gentleman,Sometimes a gentleman must shake the hand of his rival.
451,fail,How to Be a Gentleman,Comp this.

514,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,This is painful.
515,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Fine.
516,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I'll do it.
517,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Oh Look, I am on a mission."
518,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"When James sees me, I want him to realize he made a horrible mistake in Paris."

651,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Mm-hmm.

700,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Please, pay attention."
701,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,This is the most important moment of my life.
702,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Oh!

704,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,That's adorable.
705,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Yay!
706,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,No!
707,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Didn't you use condoms?
708,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"I guess, it turns out, they're not 100% effective unless you actually take them out of your purse."
709,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Billie, Billie, Billie, always use a condom."
710,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,And an alias.
711,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Is it possible that you kind of got pregnant on purpose?
712,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"I mean, maybe somewhere deep down inside, you wanted this."
713,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"You know what, Abby?"
714,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,This is just like when we were kids.
715,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,You always think you know what I'm thinking.
716,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"You always think you know exactly what I'm all about, but the truth is maybe you're right."
717,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Yes!
718,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I always wanted to be an aunt!
719,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Aunt Abby!
720,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"So, we're keeping it then?"
721,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Well, I'm a journalist."

725,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,- Oh.
726,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,- Hey.
727,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"So, how are you gonna tell the baby baby daddy?"
728,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Can we please not call him that?
729,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Let's call him the father of my niece.
730,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I want a girl.
731,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,But I finally had a boy toy.
732,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"And I only got to play with him for a couple weeks, and now my boy toy got me pregnant, and when I tell him, he's going to freak out."
733,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I broke my boy toy.
734,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I have got a ten-minute break.
735,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"So, what did you want to tell me?"
736,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Zack, I'm pregnant."

738,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Zack, are you okay?"
739,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Mm-hmm, yeah."

742,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,L- I don't know what to say.
743,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,You don't have to say anything.
744,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,You don't have to do anything.
745,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"I just needed you to know, in case, years from now, you need a kidney."
746,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,So you'd have options.
747,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"So I'm guessing this means we're done, so I'm gonna go, 'cause I just saw a rat."
748,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Rat.
749,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Rat.
750,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Rat.
751,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Wait.

753,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Wait.
754,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Wait.
755,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,You can't just say something like that and then walk away.
756,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"I mean, this is this is kind of my baby, too, right?"
757,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Couldn't have done it without you.
758,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Well, then, I want to be involved."
759,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Are you sure?
760,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Because I can do the rest without you.
761,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"I mean, it's such a big responsibility - and you're so young."
762,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"- Look, my dad walked out on me, and I used to think it was 'cause I'd done something wrong, you know?"
763,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I can't stand to think there'd be some little kid out there wondering why his dad didn't love him.
764,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
765,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I hate your dad.
766,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,We are not naming the baby after him.
767,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"I want to be there for you, okay?"
768,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,And him or her or them.
769,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"So, what do we do now, that special breathing?"
770,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,It's a little early for that.
771,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Yeah, but it's making me feel better."
772,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"I mean, I guess if you want, you can come with me to my first doctor appointment."
773,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I'll do better than that.
774,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I'll drive you there.
775,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,You will?

784,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Well, when does he get out?"
785,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,- Yesterday.
786,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,- Can't wait to meet him.
787,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Well, don't worry, I'll just sleep in the van."

789,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Well, not here."
790,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Back there, you know."
791,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,It's nice.
792,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Except when I park on a hill.
793,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Well, lucky we live in San Francisco where there are no hills."

795,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Well, I feel pretty."
796,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Cold, cold, coldy, cold, cold!"

814,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Yeah, I don't know."
815,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,I don't want to complicate your life.
816,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Why stop now?
817,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"So, you're really gonna let Zack move in?"
818,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"You're supposed to taste the rainbow, not let it live in your office."
819,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,What was I supposed to do?
820,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Let the father of my child live in a van so he could be hacked up by some crazy drifter?
821,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,He lives in a van!
822,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,He is the crazy drifter!

846,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Zack and I spoke, and he agreed we just need to set boundaries."
847,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Uh-oh.
848,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Look, I like you a lot, but we talked about this."
849,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Remember our whole boundaries conversation?

855,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"Technically, you've made a series of horrible mistakes."
856,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"I feel this weird bond with Zack, which is probably just the hormones, but I have to think of my future, you know?"
857,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"I mean, I want a husband one day."
858,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,"One with a checking account and a toothbrush he acquired via purchase rather than ""dibs."
859,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,""" I just can't believe how complicated everything got."
860,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,This?
861,fail,Accidentally on Purpose,Oh-ho-ho!

1825,fail,Rush Hour,"Carter, why are you reading the airport case file when you are not allowed to go anywhere near a case?"
1826,fail,Rush Hour,- I like to read.
1827,fail,Rush Hour,"- Yeah, right."
1828,fail,Rush Hour,"Also, see those two, very, very white guys?"
1829,fail,Rush Hour,I guarantee they're here about this.

1831,fail,Rush Hour,"Oh, Carter?"
1832,fail,Rush Hour,A word.
1833,fail,Rush Hour,No way.
1834,fail,Rush Hour,"If you like, you could watch me as I walk away."
1835,fail,Rush Hour,- Huh?

1837,fail,Rush Hour,"Admit it, you miss being my partner."
1838,fail,Rush Hour,"Carter, this is Agent Murray and Agent Weiss."
1839,fail,Rush Hour,- They're here regarding - The airport heist.
1840,fail,Rush Hour,"I'm way ahead of you, already read the reports."
1841,fail,Rush Hour,The crime took place on US soil so we're not obligated to include the Chinese in our investigation.
1842,fail,Rush Hour,"But as a courtesy, the bureau is allowing a detective from Hong Kong to consult."
1843,fail,Rush Hour,We don't have time to look after a Chinese cop.
1844,fail,Rush Hour,- But you do.
1845,fail,Rush Hour,"- Okay, I'm gonna stop you."
1846,fail,Rush Hour,'Cause it almost sounds like you're asking me to babysit.
1847,fail,Rush Hour,I hope you hate it.
1848,fail,Rush Hour,"Hey, man, I'm supposed to be meeting some Chinese cop from Hong Kong."

1909,fail,Rush Hour,"Okay, relax."
1910,fail,Rush Hour,Gerald is my cousin.

1912,fail,Rush Hour,How you doing?
1913,fail,Rush Hour,Nice to meet you.
1914,fail,Rush Hour,- No.
1915,fail,Rush Hour,- That was rude as hell.
1916,fail,Rush Hour,"Alright, and what are you doing?"
1917,fail,Rush Hour,You're not even supposed to speak English.
1918,fail,Rush Hour,I never said I don't speak English.
1919,fail,Rush Hour,I let people talk who like to talk.
1920,fail,Rush Hour,Makes it easier to find out how full of crap they are.
1921,fail,Rush Hour,"- Oh, burn!"
1922,fail,Rush Hour,Ha ha.
1923,fail,Rush Hour,- Shut up.
1924,fail,Rush Hour,"I was told a competent officer would assist me I assist no one, alright?"
1925,fail,Rush Hour,And you're not even a part of this investigation.
1926,fail,Rush Hour,I was sent here on behalf of the Chinese Government.
1927,fail,Rush Hour,"If the Feds wanted your help, why did they stick you with a cop from the LAPD?"
1928,fail,Rush Hour,You give me your intel from the Chinese side and maybe I let you work with me.
1929,fail,Rush Hour,- That sounds fair.
1930,fail,Rush Hour,- I can do this alone.
1931,fail,Rush Hour,"Okay, you wanna work alone, yeah."
1932,fail,Rush Hour,"But I'm sure you'll be fine, I mean, you know the city pretty well, right?"
1933,fail,Rush Hour,"Yes, Gerald is a low-life criminal."
1934,fail,Rush Hour,But he gives me information that helps me take down real criminals.
1935,fail,Rush Hour,I do not like this.
1936,fail,Rush Hour,Whoever did this is stone-cold.
1937,fail,Rush Hour,"Yes, this is a big job and they did it fast."
1938,fail,Rush Hour,Perps got on to the runway by knocking out the security guard and locking him in his trunk.
1939,fail,Rush Hour,"At the hospital, the guard said they looked like legit LAPD officers."
1940,fail,Rush Hour,"Now, getting cop uniforms is easy."
1941,fail,Rush Hour,It's tougher to get legit looking police cars.
1942,fail,Rush Hour,But I know someone who once used a fake cop car shaking down drug dealers for cash.
1943,fail,Rush Hour,I never heard of that story before.
1944,fail,Rush Hour,"Okay, I didn't wanna have to do this."
1945,fail,Rush Hour,- Do what?

1956,fail,Rush Hour,Alright I know a few guys who do jobs like this.
1957,fail,Rush Hour,"Hey, Gerald, been a big help for real."
1958,fail,Rush Hour,When I have the authority to do so.
1959,fail,Rush Hour,I will come back and arrest you.

1961,fail,Rush Hour,I don't like him.
1962,fail,Rush Hour,He's mean.
1963,fail,Rush Hour,"Hey, you're supposed to say something nice."
1964,fail,Rush Hour,What is wrong with you?
1965,fail,Rush Hour,Gerald always comes through.

1971,fail,Rush Hour,] Professional hit.
1972,fail,Rush Hour,"One shot, back of the head."
1973,fail,Rush Hour,Best way to keep someone from talking.

1975,fail,Rush Hour,I'm gonna teach you a little something about relationships in America.
1976,fail,Rush Hour,Behind every man who's got himself in trouble there's a woman who cannot wait to say I knew it.
1977,fail,Rush Hour,I tried to tell him.
1978,fail,Rush Hour,Don't get mixed up with bad people.
1979,fail,Rush Hour,Especially like that broke no-good son of a bitch Dicky!
1980,fail,Rush Hour,Do you have a last name on that broke no-good son of a bitch?
1981,fail,Rush Hour,Good rhythm really don't care I can take the elevator you can take the stairs Good rhythm killin' my time A little bit of luxury I really don't mind Is that Dicky Sterling.

1984,fail,Rush Hour,- Yeah.
1985,fail,Rush Hour,"- Look, man."
1986,fail,Rush Hour,"I already told the Feds, I didn't see a thing."
1987,fail,Rush Hour,Those guys beat the crap out of me.
1988,fail,Rush Hour,Locked me in the trunk of my car.
1989,fail,Rush Hour,"Yeah, yeah, I know, it just seems a little weird that the security guard that got roughed up by bad guys in fake cop cars, has a buddy known to sell fake cop cars."
1990,fail,Rush Hour,"- You think that's weird, Lee?"
1991,fail,Rush Hour,- It is peculiar.
1992,fail,Rush Hour,"Now, get in the car."
1993,fail,Rush Hour,"Unless I'm under arrest, you can get the hell out of here."
1994,fail,Rush Hour,"Well, alright, Conan O'Brien."

2007,fail,Rush Hour,You can go to jail for this.
2008,fail,Rush Hour,You lost those rights when you let bad guys on to the tarmac to shoot people and steal old statues.
2009,fail,Rush Hour,I wasn't involved.
2010,fail,Rush Hour,They almost killed me.
2011,fail,Rush Hour,"Yeah, but they didn't."
2012,fail,Rush Hour,And only thing of value that you have in is your flat screen.

2051,fail,Rush Hour,"But at least, now you get it."
2052,fail,Rush Hour,You don't want Kim goin' to jail anymore than I want Gerald locked up.
2053,fail,Rush Hour,Kim has betrayed her country and her family.

2075,fail,Rush Hour,Same thing.
2076,fail,Rush Hour,So how did Kim fall in with them?
2077,fail,Rush Hour,I don't know.
2078,fail,Rush Hour,She always felt I was holding her back but this was such a foolish choice.
2079,fail,Rush Hour,Kim was a great officer.
2080,fail,Rush Hour,I should have let her do more.
2081,fail,Rush Hour,Why didn't you?
2082,fail,Rush Hour,Our father was a cop.
2083,fail,Rush Hour,He was tough.
2084,fail,Rush Hour,All about rules and order.
2085,fail,Rush Hour,Mom was more of a free spirit like Kim.
2086,fail,Rush Hour,She made him human.
2087,fail,Rush Hour,They died in a car accident.
2088,fail,Rush Hour,Kim was just fifteen.
2089,fail,Rush Hour,And I had to be more than just a brother.
2090,fail,Rush Hour,I only wanted to protect her.
2091,fail,Rush Hour,"You and Carter, both worry so much about the people in your life."
2092,fail,Rush Hour,I used to be his partner.
2093,fail,Rush Hour,And everybody thinks that he dumped me and got me stuck on a desk but the truth is once I had Derek I didn't wanna be on the street anymore.
2094,fail,Rush Hour,"But if I asked out, ugh the other cops would never let me hear the end of it."
2095,fail,Rush Hour,So Carter took the heat.
2096,fail,Rush Hour,"You know, he doesn't have many people in his life."
2097,fail,Rush Hour,But he really protects the ones that he has.
2098,fail,Rush Hour,Like you with Kim.
2099,fail,Rush Hour,You and Carter are a lot alike.
2100,fail,Rush Hour,I consider that the greatest insult of my life.
2101,fail,Rush Hour,I get that.
2102,fail,Rush Hour,"Lee, we gotta go."
2103,fail,Rush Hour,We gotta go.
2104,fail,Rush Hour,"Captain wants to know what we've been up to, alright?"
2105,fail,Rush Hour,"So no matter what, we have not been involved in this investigation, cool?"
2106,fail,Rush Hour,But we have been very involved.
2107,fail,Rush Hour,"Look, I can get in serious trouble."
2108,fail,Rush Hour,"- Just lie, alright?"
2109,fail,Rush Hour,- Absolutely not!
2110,fail,Rush Hour,Just say as little as you can.
2111,fail,Rush Hour,- She picks up on everythin'.
2112,fail,Rush Hour,- She?
2113,fail,Rush Hour,"Guess female police chiefs aren't real common in China, huh?"
2114,fail,Rush Hour,"Just remember that in the US, a woman of power still strives to hold on to her femininity."
2115,fail,Rush Hour,So it's customary to compliment her body.
2116,fail,Rush Hour,"Captain, this is Detective Lee."
2117,fail,Rush Hour,"Detective Lee, I'm Lindsay Cole."
2118,fail,Rush Hour,"Nice to meet you, captain."
2119,fail,Rush Hour,You have beautiful legs.
2120,fail,Rush Hour,"Sorry, captain."
2121,fail,Rush Hour,You know what?
2122,fail,Rush Hour,We should go.
2123,fail,Rush Hour,- I'll go talk to him.
2124,fail,Rush Hour,"- No, no, no."
2125,fail,Rush Hour,I-I'll take it as a compliment.
2126,fail,Rush Hour,- You'd kill me if I said that.
2127,fail,Rush Hour,- Yeah.
2128,fail,Rush Hour,Because you don't look like an Asian Orlando Bloom.
2129,fail,Rush Hour,Agent Murray called me about a security guard at the Burbank Airport who was killed.
2130,fail,Rush Hour,A Richard Sterling.
2131,fail,Rush Hour,I don't know anything about this guy.
2132,fail,Rush Hour,"Come on, let's go."

2146,fail,Rush Hour,[sighs.
2147,fail,Rush Hour,] You are unfortunately correct.
2148,fail,Rush Hour,The Chinese Government's ready to pay the ransom and be done with it.

2150,fail,Rush Hour,"I have no hard evidence yet, but I won't stop until I do."
2151,fail,Rush Hour,"Well, I can't get involved until you have something real, but if you get it contact me and I'll back you up."
2152,fail,Rush Hour,"Thank you, Thomas."
2153,fail,Rush Hour,Why didn't you tell that guy your sister's still alive?
2154,fail,Rush Hour,Kim is for me to deal with.
2155,fail,Rush Hour,"You can't send her to jail, can you?"
2156,fail,Rush Hour,It'd just be like me with Gerald.
2157,fail,Rush Hour,"If the FBI pursues her, Kim can be killed."
2158,fail,Rush Hour,"She must go to jail, but I don't want her dead."
2159,fail,Rush Hour,"""I don't want her dead."
2160,fail,Rush Hour,""" That's the nicest thing I've ever heard you say."
2161,fail,Rush Hour,"That's progress, Lee."

2235,fail,Rush Hour,"When she fired, I reacted as I had to, for her."
2236,fail,Rush Hour,"If she couldn't bring herself to shoot you, that means she's not all the way bad."
2237,fail,Rush Hour,"Look, man, I think there may still be a chance for you to save her."

2260,fail,Rush Hour,I made Carter help me.
2261,fail,Rush Hour,Oh!
2262,fail,Rush Hour,"Yes, right, because he's such a pushover."

2269,fail,Rush Hour,Detective Lee your captain wants to speak to you.

2291,fail,Rush Hour,"So that bullet you had me take to ballistics, they just handed me the report."
2292,fail,Rush Hour,I think you can probably pass that information on to someone who's currently a police officer.
2293,fail,Rush Hour,(Didi) Are you sure?
2294,fail,Rush Hour,Because who is your favorite chopper pilot/gun smuggler?
2295,fail,Rush Hour,Carlos.
2296,fail,Rush Hour,I'mma hit you back.
2297,fail,Rush Hour,"Yo, get in the car."
2298,fail,Rush Hour,I gotta make a stop.

2300,fail,Rush Hour,"Man, get your ass in the car, Lee."
2301,fail,Rush Hour,I cannot violate a direct order from my captain.

2306,fail,Rush Hour,"It's not an option, it's an order."
2307,fail,Rush Hour,But those Quantou punks will still be out there killing people.
2308,fail,Rush Hour,And you'll probably never see Kim again.
2309,fail,Rush Hour,"Look, I know in your head it seems like this is just about you."
2310,fail,Rush Hour,It's not.
2311,fail,Rush Hour,"If I could close this case out, I can prove myself to Cole and get back on the job."
2312,fail,Rush Hour,And I won't admit this to a lot of people but this job is all I have.
2313,fail,Rush Hour,"Now, I'm goin' all in to finish what we started."
2314,fail,Rush Hour,But I don't know if I can get that done without you.
2315,fail,Rush Hour,"You do have a choice, Lee."
2316,fail,Rush Hour,You just have to be willin' to make it.

2329,fail,Rush Hour,And no one in here is gonna care if I take that out on you.
2330,fail,Rush Hour,We just have a few questions.
2331,fail,Rush Hour,"You give me answers, maybe I can help you out."
2332,fail,Rush Hour,We have a shell casing from a murder scene.

2346,fail,Rush Hour,This is Detective James Carter leaving a message for Carlos' attorney.
2347,fail,Rush Hour,"If the information Carlos gives me pans out, I'll make sure it's considered as States' evidence."
2348,fail,Rush Hour,And I'll lobby to get him a reduced sentence.
2349,fail,Rush Hour,What are you doing?
2350,fail,Rush Hour,You shouldn't be asking for more trouble now.
2351,fail,Rush Hour,"It's your sister, man."
2352,fail,Rush Hour,We need anything you can tell us.
2353,fail,Rush Hour,I delivered the guns to a mall.
2354,fail,Rush Hour,"Right, so you, you gave the Quantou a bunch of automatic weapons and then you all hit the food court and got to Cinepolis."

2396,fail,Rush Hour,- Okay.
2397,fail,Rush Hour,- So you scared too.
2398,fail,Rush Hour,"No, but it's okay that you are."

2880,fail,Bad Judge,"Okay, apparently I was misled again."
2881,fail,Bad Judge,"May I see the picture, please?"
2882,fail,Bad Judge,Oh.
2883,fail,Bad Judge,"It's you, Mr. Thorpe."
2884,fail,Bad Judge,Except your head is a penis.
2885,fail,Bad Judge,Actually it's very good.
2886,fail,Bad Judge,He really got you.
2887,fail,Bad Judge,"I mean, did you evaluate this?"
2888,fail,Bad Judge,"I did evaluate it, yes."
2889,fail,Bad Judge,"So, here's the story."
2890,fail,Bad Judge,Robby is having a tough time in his group home.
2891,fail,Bad Judge,He's a victim of bullying and fighting.
2892,fail,Bad Judge,And so I'm sure this is just a cry out for attention.
2893,fail,Bad Judge,"- Right, Robby?"
2894,fail,Bad Judge,- No.
2895,fail,Bad Judge,I just think Mr. Thorpe's head looks like a dong.
2896,fail,Bad Judge,That's not acceptable!
2897,fail,Bad Judge,"Mr. Thorpe, can we just look at this as an artistic expression of a frustrated child who would benefit more from guidance and understanding rather than punishment?"
2898,fail,Bad Judge,- I don't like it.
2899,fail,Bad Judge,- I understand.
2900,fail,Bad Judge,I realize I have an oddly shaped head.
2901,fail,Bad Judge,But I'm sensitive about it.
2902,fail,Bad Judge,"Mr. Thorpe, I understand, and if you'll just let me take care of this, I promise you it will never happen again."
2903,fail,Bad Judge,"Thanks so much, and you might want to just consider switching your part."
2904,fail,Bad Judge,Might help cover the curvature.
2905,fail,Bad Judge,"- Okay, thank you."
2906,fail,Bad Judge,"- All right, okay."
2907,fail,Bad Judge,I'd be happy to do portraits of your family.

2909,fail,Bad Judge,"- Oh, come on now."
2910,fail,Bad Judge,[Grunts.
2911,fail,Bad Judge,"] First off, you got to stop lying to get me to show up."
2912,fail,Bad Judge,It's not cool.
2913,fail,Bad Judge,"Second, you got to notify the head of the group home, document the bullying, and then file a police report."
2914,fail,Bad Judge,All right.
2915,fail,Bad Judge,"When this kid Alfonso comes at you, you hold up your hands like you're afraid to fight."
2916,fail,Bad Judge,"Like that, right?"
2917,fail,Bad Judge,And then boom!
2918,fail,Bad Judge,You punch him in the nose as hard as you can.
2919,fail,Bad Judge,Nothing scares a bully like seeing his own blood.
2920,fail,Bad Judge,- Hmm?
2921,fail,Bad Judge,"- You know, that's the best advice a grown-up's given me in a long time."
2922,fail,Bad Judge,Really?

2926,fail,Bad Judge,"All right, let me see your right."
2927,fail,Bad Judge,"Again, harder."
2928,fail,Bad Judge,Yeah.
2929,fail,Bad Judge,Get out of my Van.
2930,fail,Bad Judge,"Mr. Riller, before I pronounce sentencing, is there anything you or anyone on your behalf - would like to say?"
2931,fail,Bad Judge,"- Your Honor, Mrs. Riller and Mrs. Riller have agreed to petition the court for leniency."
2932,fail,Bad Judge,"Your Honor, I knew Douglas Riller as a loving husband and father to my two children from a previous marriage."
2933,fail,Bad Judge,"Your Honor, I too knew Douglas Riller as a loving husband and father to our two dobermans."
2934,fail,Bad Judge,"And although I am not happy about his lies, I have to say that he's always been there for me when I'm sick, and supportive when I was down."
2935,fail,Bad Judge,"He was also there for me when I was sick, and supportive when I was down, except for a few times when she was sick at the same time."
2936,fail,Bad Judge,Then it got tricky.
2937,fail,Bad Judge,Wow.
2938,fail,Bad Judge,I'm sorry.
2939,fail,Bad Judge,Please continue.
2940,fail,Bad Judge,The point is Douglas was there for us.
2941,fail,Bad Judge,Did he lie?
2942,fail,Bad Judge,Did he deceive?
2943,fail,Bad Judge,Yes.
2944,fail,Bad Judge,"But at the end of the day, isn't any relationship, romantic or otherwise, about showing up for someone over and over again?"
2945,fail,Bad Judge,About someone being there for someone when you need them most?
2946,fail,Bad Judge,How many of us have ever experienced that?
2947,fail,Bad Judge,"Well, I have."
2948,fail,Bad Judge,And I'm thankful for it.
2949,fail,Bad Judge,"So please, show Douglas mercy, please."
2950,fail,Bad Judge,"Oh, that's that's beautiful."
2951,fail,Bad Judge,Effed up all at the same time.
2952,fail,Bad Judge,That's kind of crazy.
2953,fail,Bad Judge,"Mr. Riller, I sentence you to time served for the charges of bigamy, and one month for the charge of falsifying identity and fraud."
2954,fail,Bad Judge,"Additionally I sentence you to take a course in feminism, the college of your choice while wearing this T-shirt to class every day."
2955,fail,Bad Judge,What?
2956,fail,Bad Judge,How am I gonna pick up girls?

3023,fail,Bad Judge,"Ooh, Edgewater?"
3024,fail,Bad Judge,Yikes.
3025,fail,Bad Judge,"58 days, man."

3033,fail,Bad Judge,- Good.
3034,fail,Bad Judge,- Thank you.
3035,fail,Bad Judge,The exhilarating and terrifying truth is that nothing adequately prepares you for how it feels to uphold the law.
3036,fail,Bad Judge,Is there a chance that you will be swallowed whole by your job?
3037,fail,Bad Judge,Yes.
3038,fail,Bad Judge,Absolutely.
3039,fail,Bad Judge,"Before you know it, you'll be using the nearest teaspoon as your makeup mirror, or to adjust the knot in your tie."
3040,fail,Bad Judge,"And it's gonna freak you out at first, by the way, because no one tells you that you appear upside down in a spoon, but you do."
3041,fail,Bad Judge,And it's an excellent reminder because the very spirit of the law is about making things right side up and doing whatever you can to keep it that way.
3042,fail,Bad Judge,[Applause.
3043,fail,Bad Judge,"] Oh, what's up?"
3044,fail,Bad Judge,There's my man.

3057,fail,Bad Judge,"Drinks on the house, everyone."
3058,fail,Bad Judge,- The judge is buying.

3116,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I got a DUI and ended up in Essex county jail.
3117,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Since it was my first time in lockdown, I didn't know what to expect."

3269,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Ha ha ha!
3270,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Love.
3271,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hi, dad."
3272,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hi, sweetie."
3273,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Your big sister told me about your DUI.
3274,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Nice work, Chelsea."
3275,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",She is such a narc.
3276,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","You need a lecture, or did you learn your lesson?"
3277,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I learned my lesson.
3278,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Good.
3279,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Enough said.
3280,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, look."
3281,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I got you a camera to film Sloane's birth.
3282,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Are you sure?
3283,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I don't want to tape over the Kennedy assassination.
3284,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","How about ""thank you,"" little missy?"
3285,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",My dad hates shelling out money for anything.
3286,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Dad, this isn't a cabbage patch doll."
3287,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It's a lettuce leaf kid.
3288,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Dad, I'm not using that piece of crap to film the birth of my first niece."
3289,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I don't know what it is with you girls about filming down there, anyway."
3290,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I was in Vietnam, and the worst thing I saw was a young gal giving birth on the side of the road."
3291,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It was a total bloodbath.
3292,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, Chels, you know, we just got a new video camera for the bar so we can show people dancing on the monitors."
3293,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Here.
3294,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Melvin, dance a little bit."
3295,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Right.
3296,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Picture that, but with hot women."
3297,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Well, here, you can borrow it if you want."
3298,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",What?
3299,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Rick, you are like the king of hooking me up."
3300,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","The camera, the apartment."
3301,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I know we've had our differences, but I am this close to giving you a handie."
3302,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Hey!
3303,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",If he's a gentleman.
3304,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, Todd, what you got there?"
3305,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Well, inspired by you, Chels, I started a little side business where I drive drunk people home in their own cars."
3306,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",And then you drive home on this thing?
3307,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Yeah.
3308,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It folds up and I put it in the trunk.
3309,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",And I put my pedal extenders in my backpack.
3310,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, can I leave some of these coupons at the bar?"
3311,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","""Driving miss drunkie."
3312,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",""" Nice!"
3313,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I'm not allowed to drive right now, but I will hand these out."
3314,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I'm very influential in the drunk community.
3315,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting."
3316,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Dad, don't pee in the alley."
3317,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Don't drink and drive.
3318,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Huh?
3319,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Jeez, look at that dude."
3320,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","All right, look, before you knock him, he's actually a really cool guy."
3321,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","He's smart, too."
3322,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",He's in I. T. And I think he went to Harvard.
3323,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Uh-huh.
3324,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Really?
3325,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","He should have gone to clown college and learned to pull fish out of his pants, like the good lord intended."
3326,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, man."
3327,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I'm Jonathan.
3328,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Rick, right?"
3329,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, yeah."
3330,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","You drink, uh, vodka and right."
3331,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",More vodka.
3332,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Vodka and more vodka?
3333,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",That's my drink.
3334,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I'm Chelsea, by the way."
3335,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It occurred to me that I had judged another human being based on his horrible clown hair without even bothering to find out what he drinks.
3336,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I began to admire him for having the confidence to walk around with a lid like that.
3337,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Obviously it wasn't his fault he was a redhead.
3338,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It was his gross ancestors.
3339,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Clearly some old bitch back there shagged the court Jester.
3340,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",What an interesting person.
3341,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","See, maybe I should go out with someone like that."
3342,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Even if he does look like Kathy Griffin.
3343,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Is he single?
3344,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Well, more importantly, is he a bottom?"
3345,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I don't need someone who's always a bottom, Rick."
3346,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Just sometimes a bottom.
3347,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Sometimes.
3348,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, whatever you need to tell yourself, Chels."
3349,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I was there.
3350,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, guys."
3351,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Quick question.
3352,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Do you want to go out sometime?
3353,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Yeah.
3354,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",My treat.
3355,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Me?
3356,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","And don't worry, we'll go somewhere cheap so you don't feel pressured to put out."
3357,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, I have low self-esteem, so I always put out."
3358,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Bottoms up!
3359,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Like 98% of women who can see, I'd never been a fan of the redheaded male."
3360,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",But Jonathan was really sweet.
3361,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",So I took him to a place where he wouldn't stick out like a freckled sore thumb.
3362,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Tommy o'Flanagan's Irish pub.
3363,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Wow, great place."
3364,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I thought you'd like it.
3365,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I do.
3366,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",You know what else I like?
3367,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Your hair.
3368,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It looks really pretty tonight.
3369,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Thanks.
3370,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",And how about your Shirt.
3371,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It's very nice.
3372,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, would you like another pint?"
3373,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I don't know, I'm kind of full."
3374,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Would it be cool if I unbuttoned the top of my pants?
3375,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","If you want, you can just take them off and wrap my coat around you."
3376,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I like where this is going.
3377,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I probably should have asked Dee Dee if it's ok to bring a cat in the apartment.
3378,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Relax, she'll be fine."
3379,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Is there a Kitty out here?
3380,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Kitty, Kitty!"
3381,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","If it's a problem, I can just pawn him off on my dad."
3382,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, no way."
3383,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I love cats.
3384,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",They just do whatever they want to do.
3385,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Meow!
3386,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Meow!
3387,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Meow!
3388,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Meow!
3389,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Wow, Dee, if you could never do that again, that would be fantastic."
3390,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I'm a cat.
3391,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I don't care what you think.
3392,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, my God."
3393,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",How do you ever get laid?
3394,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I'm waiting till I get married, like the Jonas brothers."
3395,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","So, you're a virgin?"
3396,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Everywhere?
3397,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Mm-hmm.
3398,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Of course.
3399,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Thank you.
3400,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",That is amazing.
3401,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I think the first time you open your Pikachu, confetti comes out."
3402,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I think mine whistled.
3403,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",He's so beautiful.
3404,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",What's his name?
3405,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Ass face.
3406,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Okey dokey, I'm gonna call him boots."
3407,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, my God."
3408,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",We're gonna have to get her laid.
3409,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",No.
3410,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",She is a rare and beautiful creature.
3411,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",We need to keep her exactly the way she is and stuff her when she dies.
3412,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, hey, Sloane."
3413,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Did you come to check out the new place?
3414,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","You know, we have Lamaze tonight, remember?"
3415,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",You're about to become a terrible aunt.
3416,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Sloane, I'm sorry."
3417,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I thought Lamaze was tomorrow night.
3418,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, that's so unusual."
3419,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Usually you're so protective of your brain cells.
3420,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Ha ha.
3421,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I'm supposed to work tonight.
3422,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",But I could try to find someone to cover my shift.
3423,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Olivia, can you cover my shift?"
3424,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",!
3425,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",No.
3426,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Well, that's out."
3427,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Well, this is ridiculous."
3428,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I mean, I have to go by myself?"
3429,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Sloane, come on."
3430,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It's the same thing every week.
3431,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","It's just , push, plop, done."
3432,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Can I ask you a question?
3433,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Have you ever considered about how you're gonna get me to the hospital?
3434,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Uh, cab?"
3435,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Cabs can take up to a half an hour.
3436,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I know.
3437,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",That's why everyone drives drunk.
3438,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","You know, this isn't a joke to me."
3439,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","This is me having a baby, ok?"
3440,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I need somebody I can count on, not somebody who's gonna siphon off my epidural."
3441,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Just stay home, then."
3442,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",You don't even have to come to the hospital.
3443,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Come on, you need me."
3444,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Mom's gone, and Chris is in Afghanistan."
3445,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Well, I'll ask sister Mary Francis to come."
3446,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Sister Mary Francis?
3447,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",You're gonna have someone play catcher who's never even played with a bat before?
3448,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Ok, good night, Chelsea."
3449,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Wait.
3450,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Are you seriously saying you'd rather have some old nun there than me?
3451,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Yes.
3452,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",At least she doesn't drink herself into jail on saturday nights.
3453,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",That's because she has to work on sunday morning.
3454,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I can't believe Sloane doesn't want me at the birth of my own niece?
3455,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I had so many good plans.
3456,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",One thing I wanted to do was really scare the baby right when it came out.
3457,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","That way, everything from there on out would be a piece of cake."
3458,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Simmer down, boots."
3459,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Ass face does not like to be held, Dee Dee."
3460,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",He's mean.
3461,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, no."
3462,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",You're not mean.
3463,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Mmm.
3464,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Are those scratch marks on your neck?
3465,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Yeah.
3466,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",He's angry 'cause he can't talk.
3467,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Chelsea, I've been thinking about you and your sister."
3468,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","You know, my mom and dad would fight and my dad and I would bake cupcakes for her."
3469,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Did that help?
3470,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",No.
3471,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",She became a diabetic and ran off with her doctor.
3472,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Oh.
3473,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It's ok.
3474,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",He's a really good doctor.
3475,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","He caught it early, so she still has both her feet."
3476,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I just can't get past this Sloane thing.
3477,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I just keep grinding on it.
3478,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Maybe you should grind on something else.
3479,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Clear your head, get yourself back to normal."
3480,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It has been a while since my bottom half smiled.
3481,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",There you go!
3482,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Yeah.
3483,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",What?
3484,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",That night I sent Olivia and Dee Dee to pizza hut and called Jonathan.
3485,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",He came right over.
3486,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It was as if he was just sitting in front of the phone in a halfie.
3487,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I was kind of curious to be with my first redhead.
3488,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","But while I had made peace with the drapes, I'd forgotten about the carpet."
3489,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Good lord!
3490,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It was like a clown in a leg lock.
3491,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",What's the matter?
3492,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It's justYou got a lot going on down there.
3493,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I do?
3494,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Yeah.
3495,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",But it's cute.
3496,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It's like red Easter grass.
3497,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","A little dense, though."
3498,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",There could be bunnies in there.
3499,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",What?
3500,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, I'm just kidding."
3501,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, I know."
3502,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",A little trim might make you more comfortable.
3503,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",And I got scissors in here somewhere.
3504,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Now?
3505,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Ohh.
3506,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I'm sorry, I gotta take this."
3507,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","You know what, Chelsea?"
3508,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",This is not working for me.
3509,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",What?
3510,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Wait!
3511,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","No, don't put your clothes on."
3512,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",We can just turn off the light.
3513,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Good night, Chelsea."
3514,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Dad, this better be important."
3515,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I'm with Sloane at the hospital.
3516,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",You gotta get down here.
3517,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",-Sloane's in labor?
3518,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","-Yeah, and she's having a tough time."
3519,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Get it out of me!
3520,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Ok, I'll, uh, I'll be right there."
3521,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I didn't care if we were in some stupid fight.
3522,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Over the years, whenever I got into trouble, Sloane was always there to bail me out."
3523,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","So when that baby came bailing out of her, I wanted to be there to catch it."
3524,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Seriously, dad, I don't think this epidural is working."
3525,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Think of the pioneer women, sweetie."
3526,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",All they could do was scream and bite on a rag.
3527,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Or die!
3528,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Hi.
3529,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I know you said not to come to the hospital, but get your ass in here."
3530,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Sister Mary Francis is dead to me!
3531,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Ok, one in, one out."
3532,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I think those are the rules.
3533,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I don't think I can do this, Chelsea."
3534,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Sloane, you can do this."
3535,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Girls at the prom do this all the time.
3536,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Just out of curiosity, what do you girls wear under that getup?"
3537,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Buy me a pack of smokes and I'll tell you.
3538,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, look at her."
3539,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",She is fantastic.
3540,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I know.
3541,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I'm so crazy about her already.
3542,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Let's see how you feel when you see what she did to your entertainment center.
3543,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Have you decided on a name yet?
3544,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Yes.

3548,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Sylvia.
3549,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Dad's gonna love that.
3550,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",He's such a kiss-ass.
3551,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I know.
3552,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","I know you hate when I say goopy stuff to you, but I have to tell you that I don't think I could have done this without you."
3553,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I really mean it.
3554,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Thank you.
3555,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Just for the record, you pooped a little when you were pushing."
3556,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I know.
3557,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",I did that for you.
3558,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Have a cigar.
3559,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Sir, cigar."
3560,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Chels, congratulations."
3561,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Thanks.
3562,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Yeah, you finally have someone to call baby who's not on top of you."

3564,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Dee Dee, have a cigar."
3565,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh, no, thank you."
3566,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Then at least do your shot.
3567,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It smells like oven cleaner.
3568,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Just close your eyes and down it or else you hate the baby.
3569,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Oh Oh, I think my ears popped."
3570,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",The dance floor is now open!
3571,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Hey, Chels, where's the camera?"
3572,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",It's right there.
3573,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","All right, everybody, if you would be so kind as to turn your attention to our monitors Aaahhhh!"
3574,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Whoa!
3575,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Huh.
3576,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",That's my bad.
3577,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","Well, I promised vodka I would turn my life around, and two weeks later I have a new apartment and I have a new niece who I helped bring into the world."
3578,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?",Trying to trim a redhead ridiculous.
3579,fail,"Are You There, Chelsea?","But as far as relationships go, you never know what fate might put in your path."

3592,fail,Animal Practice,"Good news, Ms. Watts, Giggles is going to be just fine."
3593,fail,Animal Practice,"Oh, it's a miracle."
3594,fail,Animal Practice,"Actually, it's a phenomenon called ""high rise syndrome."
3595,fail,Animal Practice,""" Cats that fall instinctively twist their bodies into a riding reflex, but I believe what Giggles did was more likely a cry for help."
3596,fail,Animal Practice,Are you saying my cat tried to-- Tried to commit suicide?
3597,fail,Animal Practice,Yes.
3598,fail,Animal Practice,I believe she's trying to tell you something.
3599,fail,Animal Practice,Like what?
3600,fail,Animal Practice,Giggles is very happy.
3601,fail,Animal Practice,Your cat's in heat.
3602,fail,Animal Practice,Set her free.
3603,fail,Animal Practice,Let her meet someone that's gonna grab her by the scruff of her neck and make her purr so loud that the neighbors will complain.

3614,fail,Animal Practice,"- Why am I the one over here expressing glands, and you guys are over there, bettin' on the ponies?"
3615,fail,Animal Practice,"Well, you're sort of betting too."
3616,fail,Animal Practice,- Excuse me?
3617,fail,Animal Practice,- Remember you loaned me money to build a gazebo?
3618,fail,Animal Practice,"Oh, man."
3619,fail,Animal Practice,"Come-- That was gazebo money, Yamamoto."
3620,fail,Animal Practice,"My wife's in charge of my checking account, all right?"
3621,fail,Animal Practice,- She doesn't like gambling!
3622,fail,Animal Practice,- So then don't gamble.
3623,fail,Animal Practice,"Tell your wife to eat it, Yamamoto."

3672,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, Rizzo."
3673,fail,Animal Practice,Did you get a haircut?
3674,fail,Animal Practice,Don't suck up to the monkey.
3675,fail,Animal Practice,"Okay, George, uh, we need to talk."
3676,fail,Animal Practice,I was expecting this.
3677,fail,Animal Practice,"Two years ago, you walked out on our relationship without any explanation, so now you're here to apologize?"
3678,fail,Animal Practice,That's not exactly how I remember it.
3679,fail,Animal Practice,- Apology accepted.
3680,fail,Animal Practice,"- George-- Although, in my mind, when we had this conversation, that skirt was right over there on that table."
3681,fail,Animal Practice,"George, my grandmother left me the hospital."
3682,fail,Animal Practice,You don't know the first thing about running a hospital.
3683,fail,Animal Practice,Why would she leave it to you?
3684,fail,Animal Practice,"Well, because I promised her that I'd pour my soul into this place."
3685,fail,Animal Practice,That's stupid.
3686,fail,Animal Practice,Are you sure this isn't just an elaborate ploy to get back in my pants?
3687,fail,Animal Practice,It's not really hard to get into your pants.
3688,fail,Animal Practice,I'll give you that.
3689,fail,Animal Practice,"I have been running up and down these halls since I was a little girl, okay?"
3690,fail,Animal Practice,"And I know that I can improve things here, starting with that mess of a waiting room."
3691,fail,Animal Practice,"Come on, follow me."
3692,fail,Animal Practice,Not gonna follow you.
3693,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, hey, I've won three canine awards and a Mountain Dew meow."

3696,fail,Animal Practice,- Name one thing.
3697,fail,Animal Practice,"- For starters, maybe start caring about the owners."
3698,fail,Animal Practice,There's been a man waiting out there for three days.
3699,fail,Animal Practice,That is-- that-- that is a long time.
3700,fail,Animal Practice,You are an incredible vet but a lousy director.
3701,fail,Animal Practice,"My system may not be perfect, but I help a lot of animals, and I meet a lot of girls."
3702,fail,Animal Practice,My system is perfect.
3703,fail,Animal Practice,I'm not gonna sit around and let you turn my grandmother's legacy into a zoo.
3704,fail,Animal Practice,Really?

3706,fail,Animal Practice,He's doin' his rounds.
3707,fail,Animal Practice,Wowie.

3709,fail,Animal Practice,Can't believe it.
3710,fail,Animal Practice,I can't believe how fat she got.
3711,fail,Animal Practice,You wish.
3712,fail,Animal Practice,She looks fantastic.
3713,fail,Animal Practice,Don't get used to it.
3714,fail,Animal Practice,She'll be gone in a week.
3715,fail,Animal Practice,"I don't know, George."
3716,fail,Animal Practice,I always kinda had a feeling that you two were gonna end up together.
3717,fail,Animal Practice,Monogamy is unnatural.
3718,fail,Animal Practice,"Of all the species on this planet, only 20 mate for l-- You know who mates for life?"
3719,fail,Animal Practice,- Termites.
3720,fail,Animal Practice,- Termites.

3722,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, can I talk to you as a friend?"
3723,fail,Animal Practice,I'm not keen on being friends.
3724,fail,Animal Practice,Can I talk to you as somebody who's worked with you for the better part of a decade?
3725,fail,Animal Practice,Even that makes me uncomfortable.
3726,fail,Animal Practice,"George, my girlfriend left me for Dr. Shankar."
3727,fail,Animal Practice,Dr. Shankar?
3728,fail,Animal Practice,That guy's a good catch.
3729,fail,Animal Practice,"Come on, man."

3736,fail,Animal Practice,I have opposable thumbs.
3737,fail,Animal Practice,You got to show her you're still the Alpha male.
3738,fail,Animal Practice,What would Harvey do?
3739,fail,Animal Practice,"Confront Shankar, establish dominance."
3740,fail,Animal Practice,"Like, you want me to kill him?"
3741,fail,Animal Practice,"And we all sing oh, well, I never!"

3743,fail,Animal Practice,"oh, well, I never!"

3749,fail,Animal Practice,- You're still here?
3750,fail,Animal Practice,"Look, George, I know that working together may be a little awkward at first or very awkward forever, but the important thing is is that we both love this place, so we can learn from each other."
3751,fail,Animal Practice,- You can learn from me.
3752,fail,Animal Practice,- And you me.
3753,fail,Animal Practice,- Just you me.
3754,fail,Animal Practice,"- Okay, fine."

3772,fail,Animal Practice,"- Surgery's $2,000."
3773,fail,Animal Practice,- 2 grand?
3774,fail,Animal Practice,"I could buy, like, six dogs that wouldn't piss me off for 2 grand."
3775,fail,Animal Practice,I don't want to pay that.
3776,fail,Animal Practice,What you want doesn't matter.
3777,fail,Animal Practice,"When you brought this dog into your home, you signed an unwritten contract to feed it, care for it, and, yes, provide medical care if need be."
3778,fail,Animal Practice,"Okay, look, if money is an issue, we can-- Hold on, I'm on a roll!"
3779,fail,Animal Practice,"Now, you're gonna pay this money, I'm gonna operate."
3780,fail,Animal Practice,"If you have a problem with that, then next time, don't leave your crap lying around."

3788,fail,Animal Practice,""" Look, you're not putting her to sleep."
3789,fail,Animal Practice,"Okay, let's ""put it down"" then?"
3790,fail,Animal Practice,I'm starting to get annoyed with your air quotes.
3791,fail,Animal Practice,"I find them quite useful, like when referring to - a veterinarian as a ""doctor."
3792,fail,Animal Practice,""" - Okay, Mr. Waxman-- Save your breath."
3793,fail,Animal Practice,"Don't you see that his premature balding and feminine hands indicate masculinity issues, not unlike a dog who barks with no bite."
3794,fail,Animal Practice,- I'm taking this animal.
3795,fail,Animal Practice,- What?
3796,fail,Animal Practice,"No, hey!"
3797,fail,Animal Practice,That is not your dog.

3802,fail,Animal Practice,"George, what are you doing?"
3803,fail,Animal Practice,"If we have any chance of saving this dog, we have to reason with that guy."
3804,fail,Animal Practice,People are incapable of reason.
3805,fail,Animal Practice,Why do you think they keep eating at Arby's?
3806,fail,Animal Practice,"Oh, only you eat at Arby's!"
3807,fail,Animal Practice,You still won't admit that arby's is delicious!
3808,fail,Animal Practice,Ow.
3809,fail,Animal Practice,Hey!
3810,fail,Animal Practice,Don't.
3811,fail,Animal Practice,"Whoa, whoa."

3813,fail,Animal Practice,"All right, we tried things your way, and now we go back to mine."
3814,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, Rizzo, scrub in."
3815,fail,Animal Practice,Rizzo is not scrubbing in.
3816,fail,Animal Practice,Smooch him.
3817,fail,Animal Practice,Smooch him.
3818,fail,Animal Practice,What?
3819,fail,Animal Practice,Am I the only one who can sense the sexy tension?
3820,fail,Animal Practice,Has anyone seen Dr. Coleman?
3821,fail,Animal Practice,"About this high, emotionally unavailable?"
3822,fail,Animal Practice,"George, does having this new director mean I gotta take another drug test?"
3823,fail,Animal Practice,"Not a good time, Angela."
3824,fail,Animal Practice,Because I passed the first one fair and square.
3825,fail,Animal Practice,"It's like a double jeopardy situation, and Frank agrees."
3826,fail,Animal Practice,Who's Frank?
3827,fail,Animal Practice,My parole officer.
3828,fail,Animal Practice,You call your parole officer by his first name?
3829,fail,Animal Practice,"Well, yeah."
3830,fail,Animal Practice,"Once we started doing it, ""Officer Kalinowski"" was just a mouthful."
3831,fail,Animal Practice,- Excuse me.
3832,fail,Animal Practice,"- Ms. Crane, I am not peeing in a cup unless it's for money - or love."
3833,fail,Animal Practice,- Okay.
3834,fail,Animal Practice,"Well, thank you, Angela."
3835,fail,Animal Practice,That's good to know.
3836,fail,Animal Practice,Mm-hmm.
3837,fail,Animal Practice,"George, where did you hide Waxman's dog?"
3838,fail,Animal Practice,I can't tell you that.
3839,fail,Animal Practice,Doctor-patient confidentiality.
3840,fail,Animal Practice,Aha!
3841,fail,Animal Practice,So you admit that you hid him.
3842,fail,Animal Practice,"You don't get to ""aha"" about that."
3843,fail,Animal Practice,I basically just told you.
3844,fail,Animal Practice,Bengal tiger giving birth!
3845,fail,Animal Practice,There were complications at the zoo!
3846,fail,Animal Practice,Give her two ccs of ketamine and one cc of medetomidine!

3855,fail,Animal Practice,I'm not sorry.
3856,fail,Animal Practice,This is goin' on the highlight reel.
3857,fail,Animal Practice,Traitors!
3858,fail,Animal Practice,This is not working for me.

3860,fail,Animal Practice,"Fine, fine, you win."
3861,fail,Animal Practice,Dr. Wong's office.
3862,fail,Animal Practice,"- Thank you, George."
3863,fail,Animal Practice,- You're welcome.
3864,fail,Animal Practice,"George, there's no Dr. Wong here, is there?"

3878,fail,Animal Practice,That's your second strike.
3879,fail,Animal Practice,What was my first strike?
3880,fail,Animal Practice,When did we get on a strike system?
3881,fail,Animal Practice,And covering my morning shifts for the next month - is not gonna make it up to me.
3882,fail,Animal Practice,- Then I'll cover two months.
3883,fail,Animal Practice,"Make it four, and then I'll let you buy me dinner."
3884,fail,Animal Practice,"Thank you so much, George, but not tomorrow night 'cause Doug and I have dinner with Dorothy."
3885,fail,Animal Practice,"N- not the Dorothy that you know, we know an African-American Dorothy."
3886,fail,Animal Practice,Good one.
3887,fail,Animal Practice,Why are you having dinner with Dorothy?
3888,fail,Animal Practice,"Frankly, it's none of your business."
3889,fail,Animal Practice,"Yamamoto, tell me everything."

3892,fail,Animal Practice,- He wanted romantic love advice.
3893,fail,Animal Practice,- Oh.

3895,fail,Animal Practice,"I'm a coward, and you know that."
3896,fail,Animal Practice,"Dorothy thinks, and I-- I happen to agree that I just-- I need some time to heal myself emotionally."
3897,fail,Animal Practice,I gave you all the advice you need.
3898,fail,Animal Practice,"Yeah, and your advice sucked."
3899,fail,Animal Practice,"I confronted Dr. Shankar, just like you told me to, in front of my girlfriend, and he kicked my ass."
3900,fail,Animal Practice,And his girlfriend saw everything.
3901,fail,Animal Practice,It was so humiliating.
3902,fail,Animal Practice,So she wasn't even a little bit turned on?
3903,fail,Animal Practice,"No, in fact, there's a restraining order filed against me now, and I have to stay at least 50 yards away from her at all times."
3904,fail,Animal Practice,You need to move on.
3905,fail,Animal Practice,It's time to wrestle with another gazelle.
3906,fail,Animal Practice,I am not a gazelle.

3956,fail,Animal Practice,"That is-- What I'm saying is, judging from the paw size on that guy-- He's a very healthy dog."
3957,fail,Animal Practice,He is gonna live to be at least eight.
3958,fail,Animal Practice,But he's already ten.
3959,fail,Animal Practice,- Look at that.
3960,fail,Animal Practice,- Is he?
3961,fail,Animal Practice,Every day's a gift.

3967,fail,Animal Practice,"Oh, good."
3968,fail,Animal Practice,"George, tap me out!"
3969,fail,Animal Practice,"- No, you're doin' great."
3970,fail,Animal Practice,"- I'm losing, George."
3971,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, George, can I have a word with you?"
3972,fail,Animal Practice,Huh?
3973,fail,Animal Practice,"Yeah, I got a minute."
3974,fail,Animal Practice,"Very funny, Yamamoto."
3975,fail,Animal Practice,"I'm losing, George!"
3976,fail,Animal Practice,I need help.
3977,fail,Animal Practice,- So I talked to Waxman - Mm.
3978,fail,Animal Practice,"And he just wants one thing, whole mess goes away."
3979,fail,Animal Practice,"Great, happy to do it."
3980,fail,Animal Practice,You're not gonna be happy to do it.
3981,fail,Animal Practice,- You don't know me.
3982,fail,Animal Practice,- I do.
3983,fail,Animal Practice,"No, I've changed."
3984,fail,Animal Practice,Whole new person.

3989,fail,Animal Practice,I don't work with people.
3990,fail,Animal Practice,This is my hospital.
3991,fail,Animal Practice,"I'm not going halfsies, so please disappear the way that you did last time."
3992,fail,Animal Practice,- What are you saying?
3993,fail,Animal Practice,"- Two years ago, I leave to go pick us up some thai food, when I get back, you're gone."
3994,fail,Animal Practice,No explanation.
3995,fail,Animal Practice,And do you remember what I said to you before you went to go get that thai food?
3996,fail,Animal Practice,"""I want Tom Yum Goong."
3997,fail,Animal Practice,""" I told you I loved you, and do you remember what you said back to me?"
3998,fail,Animal Practice,"""Awesome."
3999,fail,Animal Practice,""" I told you I loved you, and you said, ""awesome."
4000,fail,Animal Practice,""" You know what?"
4001,fail,Animal Practice,"This little experiment of us working together is goin' bust, so if you're not leaving, then I will."
4002,fail,Animal Practice,- You're not leaving.
4003,fail,Animal Practice,- I am leaving.
4004,fail,Animal Practice,I quit.
4005,fail,Animal Practice,"- George, don't do this."
4006,fail,Animal Practice,- Watch me.
4007,fail,Animal Practice,Fine.
4008,fail,Animal Practice,I guess you get to be the one who leaves now.
4009,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, George, if you're done over there, can you help me out?"
4010,fail,Animal Practice,Don't forget jaws.
4011,fail,Animal Practice,I told myself I wasn't gonna cry.
4012,fail,Animal Practice,I lied to myself.
4013,fail,Animal Practice,"Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey."
4014,fail,Animal Practice,"He's fine, okay?"
4015,fail,Animal Practice,"He's probably got offers from, like, five different hospitals already."
4016,fail,Animal Practice,You're a really bad lady.
4017,fail,Animal Practice,- You're worse than my wife.
4018,fail,Animal Practice,- Oh.
4019,fail,Animal Practice,But you're still sexy.
4020,fail,Animal Practice,He's a riddle.
4021,fail,Animal Practice,I- I-- Waxman called.
4022,fail,Animal Practice,"He's gonna be here in an hour, and he's threatening to call the police."
4023,fail,Animal Practice,I can't fix anything until I find the dog.
4024,fail,Animal Practice,Do you-- do you have any idea of where George would hide the dog?
4025,fail,Animal Practice,No.
4026,fail,Animal Practice,But I got a feeling I know who does.
4027,fail,Animal Practice,"Sorry, Ms. Crane, but we have a fifth amendment situation on our hands, and you're gonna have to talk to my attorney, but good luck with that, 'cause he's in Rikers, doing five to sev-- - I'll give you Columbus Day off."
4028,fail,Animal Practice,"Throw in Arbor Day, and we have a deal."
4029,fail,Animal Practice,- Done.
4030,fail,Animal Practice,"- One missing yorkie, comin' right up."
4031,fail,Animal Practice,"George sure had you running in circles, didn't he?"
4032,fail,Animal Practice,"Yeah, wouldn't be the first time."
4033,fail,Animal Practice,"You know, not all dogs go to heaven."
4034,fail,Animal Practice,Sometimes they just end up in the ground.
4035,fail,Animal Practice,"Uh, I'll-- I'll just take the next one."
4036,fail,Animal Practice,"No, no, no."
4037,fail,Animal Practice,"Come on in, it's your elevator now."
4038,fail,Animal Practice,"Rizzo, make room."
4039,fail,Animal Practice,Okay.
4040,fail,Animal Practice,"Thanks, Rizzo."
4041,fail,Animal Practice,You're such a gentleman.
4042,fail,Animal Practice,- Goin' home early?
4043,fail,Animal Practice,- Yeah.
4044,fail,Animal Practice,"Yeah, it's been a hard day."
4045,fail,Animal Practice,Mm-hmm.
4046,fail,Animal Practice,"Ten years of being here, everything I have fits in this box."
4047,fail,Animal Practice,You know I didn't want it this way.
4048,fail,Animal Practice,"No, no."
4049,fail,Animal Practice,I'm glad.
4050,fail,Animal Practice,I'm going on vacation.
4051,fail,Animal Practice,"Rizzo's always wanted to learn how to water-ski, so-- - How's it going with Waxman?"
4052,fail,Animal Practice,- Great.
4053,fail,Animal Practice,Great.
4054,fail,Animal Practice,Got it all under control.
4055,fail,Animal Practice,Then why is your purse barking?
4056,fail,Animal Practice,I was gonna pose as her owner and take her to another animal hospital.
4057,fail,Animal Practice,- Interesting.
4058,fail,Animal Practice,- What am I supposed to do?
4059,fail,Animal Practice,Okay?
4060,fail,Animal Practice,"She needs the surgery, and I don't want any doctors here getting into trouble."
4061,fail,Animal Practice,If only you knew a doctor here who's not a doctor here.
4062,fail,Animal Practice,Okay.
4063,fail,Animal Practice,You believe that miscreant wanted to put this beautiful dog to sleep?
4064,fail,Animal Practice,Wonder why I'm not a fan of most people.
4065,fail,Animal Practice,One day you're gonna have to accept the fact that you're part of the human race.
4066,fail,Animal Practice,Are we really that bad?
4067,fail,Animal Practice,- Hold this right here.
4068,fail,Animal Practice,- Right here?
4069,fail,Animal Practice,- Yup.
4070,fail,Animal Practice,- Okay.
4071,fail,Animal Practice,- Don't move.
4072,fail,Animal Practice,- Just like that?
4073,fail,Animal Practice,Whoa.
4074,fail,Animal Practice,- What'd you do?
4075,fail,Animal Practice,- What?
4076,fail,Animal Practice,"No, what?"
4077,fail,Animal Practice,- I didn't do anything.
4078,fail,Animal Practice,- What did you do?
4079,fail,Animal Practice,You did.
4080,fail,Animal Practice,"- No, you did something."
4081,fail,Animal Practice,- I just did what you told me to do.
4082,fail,Animal Practice,I haven't even moved it.
4083,fail,Animal Practice,Just kidding.
4084,fail,Animal Practice,Oh.
4085,fail,Animal Practice,"Well, Mr. Waxman, I guess you are what your dog eats."
4086,fail,Animal Practice,Honey!
4087,fail,Animal Practice,"Oh, easy, Lily."
4088,fail,Animal Practice,Honey's had a rough day.
4089,fail,Animal Practice,You kidnap my dog and then perform surgery?
4090,fail,Animal Practice,"Yes, I did."
4091,fail,Animal Practice,You can pay on your way out.
4092,fail,Animal Practice,You better lawyer up 'cause I'm gonna sue you and you - and the monkey!
4093,fail,Animal Practice,"- Dr. Coleman, will you please show Mr. Waxman what you removed from Honey's stomach?"
4094,fail,Animal Practice,I believe this is a coaster from Dazzles.
4095,fail,Animal Practice,- Dazzles is a strip club.
4096,fail,Animal Practice,- Yeah.
4097,fail,Animal Practice,"Big scoop, divorced man frequents strip club."
4098,fail,Animal Practice,So what?
4099,fail,Animal Practice,Here's what.
4100,fail,Animal Practice,"Your little girl's gonna grow up and one day figure out that her father, who she trusted and loved, killed her dog because she ate a coaster from a strip club, and this is gonna fill her with such anger towards you, that in ten years, you're gonna walk into Dazzles, and find that swinging from a pole is none other than your little girl."
4101,fail,Animal Practice,And you know what name I bet she's gonna go by?
4102,fail,Animal Practice,Honey!
4103,fail,Animal Practice,We accept all major credit cards.
4104,fail,Animal Practice,That felt awesome.
4105,fail,Animal Practice,"See, ""awesome"" is not that bad a word."
4106,fail,Animal Practice,"Good luck with this place, Dorothy."
4107,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, I would, uh, tell you that I am sad to see you leave, but that would probably just make you uncomfortable, right?"
4108,fail,Animal Practice,It's already making me uncomfortable.
4109,fail,Animal Practice,Exactly.
4110,fail,Animal Practice,That is why I'm here to tell you something that I know you will appreciate.
4111,fail,Animal Practice,You will never guess what happened to me last night.
4112,fail,Animal Practice,You took home a curvaceous redhead who attacked you with a sexual ferocity you've never known before.
4113,fail,Animal Practice,Yeah.
4114,fail,Animal Practice,Wha-- ?
4115,fail,Animal Practice,That was a shockingly accurate guess.
4116,fail,Animal Practice,"That's, uh, eh, like, you got me a hooker."
4117,fail,Animal Practice,You got me a hooker.
4118,fail,Animal Practice,I didn't get you a hooker.
4119,fail,Animal Practice,"I may have mentioned the name of your favorite bar to Dr. Shankar's ex-girlfriend, who also did not appreciate getting dumped."
4120,fail,Animal Practice,Really?
4121,fail,Animal Practice,You made that happen?
4122,fail,Animal Practice,You bet.
4123,fail,Animal Practice,"As any Siberian tiger will illustrate, revenge is a subhuman instinct."
4124,fail,Animal Practice,Siberian tigers will spend weeks hunting and killing anything that's harmed them.
4125,fail,Animal Practice,Humans call this an anger bang or a grudge f-- Yes!
4126,fail,Animal Practice,"Yes, I heard that one before."
4127,fail,Animal Practice,"I told you, George, didn't I?"
4128,fail,Animal Practice,You are a friend.
4129,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, Doug, uh, can I get a second with George?"
4130,fail,Animal Practice,"Oh, I guess so."
4131,fail,Animal Practice,Please unpack your box.
4132,fail,Animal Practice,"At the end of the day, it's about the animals, and nobody knows animals like George Coleman."
4133,fail,Animal Practice,"Come on, Dorothy."
4134,fail,Animal Practice,Too much history for us both to be here.
4135,fail,Animal Practice,"I don't believe that, and I'd like to think that you don't either."
4136,fail,Animal Practice,"I hope I see you tomorrow, George."
4137,fail,Animal Practice,Oh.
4138,fail,Animal Practice,Taxi!
4139,fail,Animal Practice,Hey!
4140,fail,Animal Practice,What?
4141,fail,Animal Practice,I should've said it.
4142,fail,Animal Practice,I should've told you how I felt two years ago.
4143,fail,Animal Practice,"Wow, George."
4144,fail,Animal Practice,You may actually have a heart in there.
4145,fail,Animal Practice,"Heart's just a muscle, Dorothy, nothing more."
4146,fail,Animal Practice,"If I'm gonna romanticize an organ, it certainly won't be that one."
4147,fail,Animal Practice,So this is gonna be okay?
4148,fail,Animal Practice,You tried to sneak a dog out in your purse today to save it.
4149,fail,Animal Practice,That is impetuous and stupid.
4150,fail,Animal Practice,That was like something I would've done.
4151,fail,Animal Practice,Want to get a drink?
4152,fail,Animal Practice,I don't think so.
4153,fail,Animal Practice,"Come on, just a drink."
4154,fail,Animal Practice,"No, it's never just a drink with us."
4155,fail,Animal Practice,"I know, that's why I like drinking with you."
4156,fail,Animal Practice,"Good night, George."
4157,fail,Animal Practice,"I was listening the whole time, George, and she wants it."
4158,fail,Animal Practice,"I mean, like, she wants to do the horizontal hula, and by, like, the horizontal hula, I mean she wants you to put your bread into her basket."
4159,fail,Animal Practice,"Yeah, no, I got you."
4160,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, you still want to get that drink?"
4161,fail,Animal Practice,"Yeah, I don't know."
4162,fail,Animal Practice,Got some beers I took from some kids.
4163,fail,Animal Practice,Told 'em I was a cop.
4164,fail,Animal Practice,Idiots.
4165,fail,Animal Practice,"Hey, have you seen Dr. Coleman?"
4166,fail,Animal Practice,George?
4167,fail,Animal Practice,"Oh, sorry."
4168,fail,Animal Practice,I didn't mean to interrupt.
4169,fail,Animal Practice,You weren't interrupting.
4170,fail,Animal Practice,We're just inspecting the fractured femur of a St. Bernard - that came in yesterday.
4171,fail,Animal Practice,- Oh.
4172,fail,Animal Practice,"Well, I'm glad to hear things are running so smoothly."
4173,fail,Animal Practice,- Go!
4174,fail,Animal Practice,Go!
4175,fail,Animal Practice,Go!
4176,fail,Animal Practice,- Yes!
4177,fail,Animal Practice,"- Oh, no!"
4178,fail,Animal Practice,- Come on!
4179,fail,Animal Practice,Come on!
4180,fail,Animal Practice,- Yes!
4181,fail,Animal Practice,- Yeah!
4182,fail,Animal Practice,Boom!
4183,fail,Animal Practice,Yeah!
4184,fail,Animal Practice,- Still goin'!
4185,fail,Animal Practice,- I told you.
4186,fail,Animal Practice,"- Pay up, Riz."
4187,fail,Animal Practice,"- Pay him, monkey."
4188,fail,Animal Practice,"Come on, monkey, pay up."
4189,fail,Animal Practice,All of it.
4190,fail,Animal Practice,All of it.
4191,fail,Animal Practice,Thank you.
4192,fail,Animal Practice,"Eat it, Rizzo."
4193,fail,Mulaney,"Growing up is weird, though."
4194,fail,Mulaney,"Like I'm 30 now, and I have this new phenomenon in my life where, late at night, when I'm on the street, women will look at me like I'm a threat."
4195,fail,Mulaney,"Yeah, that is funny."
4196,fail,Mulaney,"It's also weird, because I'm still afraid of being kidnapped."
4197,fail,Mulaney,"But once, I walking towards the subway at 2:00 in the morning Walking towards the subway, and there was this woman in front of me, and she was walking along, but she kept giving me, like, the ""over the shoulder,"" like that."
4198,fail,Mulaney,And then she started to walk a lot faster.
4199,fail,Mulaney,"So I thought, oh, she must hear the train coming."
4200,fail,Mulaney,Or maybe she feels it in her feet like a native American in a movie.
4201,fail,Mulaney,"So I started to sprint towards the subway at her, and she looked back and she was like, ""aah""!"
4202,fail,Mulaney,"And then she gives chase, so now we're booking it towards the subway at 2:00 in the morning, and I'm gaining on her."
4203,fail,Mulaney,"And I'm gaining on her, and we're getting to the end of the subway hallway, and she goes into that ""dead end shuffle,"" you know, that women do when you chase 'em, and I'm almost at her."
4204,fail,Mulaney,"I'm almost at her, and then it dawns on me, ""oh, she's running from me, because in her eyes, I'm an adult."
4205,fail,Mulaney,And adults murder each other.
4206,fail,Mulaney,""" So I wanted to go up to her and be like, ""Hey, no, I'm not a man."
4207,fail,Mulaney,""" But I think that that would be equally creepy Is if you were in a subway at 2:00 in the morning and I chased you down, grabbed you and said, ""I'm not gonna kill you."
4208,fail,Mulaney,I'm a little boy.
4209,fail,Mulaney,""" SO1EO1 Pilot Mulaney is filmed in front of a live studio audience, okay?"
4210,fail,Mulaney,"Thanks for coming with me, Motif."
4211,fail,Mulaney,"It's no problem, I was free."
4212,fail,Mulaney,"Hey, can I be your emergency contact?"
4213,fail,Mulaney,"Yeah, I mean, I normally put my mom, but I guess we're roommates."
4214,fail,Mulaney,Let's do it.
4215,fail,Mulaney,It's also good promotion for me.
4216,fail,Mulaney,"Matter of fact, don't put my phone number down, put down on my web site: Oh, and write down they should skip my intro."
4217,fail,Mulaney,Yeah.
4218,fail,Mulaney,All right.
4219,fail,Mulaney,Why am I at the doctor?
4220,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, ""frequent urination."
4221,fail,Mulaney,""" That's a good fake reason."
4222,fail,Mulaney,I thought you wanted to ask the doctor for Xanax.
4223,fail,Mulaney,"Well, I do, but I can't just come right out and ask a doctor for Xanax, Motif."
4224,fail,Mulaney,Looks shady when you're honest with doctors.
4225,fail,Mulaney,"I need to make up a reason to be here and then let the doctor check me out and then when he's done I say offhandedly, ""oh, and you know what?"
4226,fail,Mulaney,Sometimes I get nervous on airplanes.
4227,fail,Mulaney,""" Bam, Xanax."
4228,fail,Mulaney,What do you need Xanax for anyway?
4229,fail,Mulaney,"I'm anxious all the time, like, in every situation."
4230,fail,Mulaney,"Like, I've noticed lately, this is my regular speaking voice."
4231,fail,Mulaney,- Mm-hmm.
4232,fail,Mulaney,"- I go into a whole different speaking voice when I'm in a public bathroom and someone suddenly knocks on the door, and that voice is, ""Someone's in here!"
4233,fail,Mulaney,"Someone's in here""!"
4234,fail,Mulaney,"As if they're gonna be like, ""oh, I think there's a carnival barker in there."
4235,fail,Mulaney,I think someone's trying to drum up business for a carnival.
4236,fail,Mulaney,""" Plus today, I have a meeting with Lou Cannon."
4237,fail,Mulaney,- That's right!
4238,fail,Mulaney,TV's Lou Cannon.

4250,fail,Mulaney,I am not crazy!
4251,fail,Mulaney,"Hi, Jane."
4252,fail,Mulaney,"Why are you walking into rooms yelling, ""I am not crazy""?"
4253,fail,Mulaney,"It's not fair, okay?"
4254,fail,Mulaney,"When a guy wants to destroy a woman, all he has to do is call her crazy, even if she has every right to be angry."
4255,fail,Mulaney,"Hey, men get called crazy too."
4256,fail,Mulaney,"Yeah, but people like it when a man's crazy."
4257,fail,Mulaney,"We have recordings of Christian Bale screaming like a lunatic, and people are impressed."
4258,fail,Mulaney,"They're like, ""oh, my God, he's so passionate about his process."
4259,fail,Mulaney,""" Meanwhile there is a rumor that Katherine Heigl is difficult, and she's, like, dead."
4260,fail,Mulaney,"So who called you crazy, Janey?"
4261,fail,Mulaney,"Dustin emailed that new girl he's dating and was like, ""my ex-girlfriend is crazy."
4262,fail,Mulaney,""" And how did you see that email?"
4263,fail,Mulaney,He should change - His password.
4264,fail,Mulaney,"- Oh, my God."
4265,fail,Mulaney,You have got to stop that stuff.
4266,fail,Mulaney,You're gonna get caught.
4267,fail,Mulaney,It's so irresponsible.
4268,fail,Mulaney,"Now then, I have to go lie to this doctor so that I am drugged-up enough for my job interview."
4269,fail,Mulaney,I'll be back.
4270,fail,Mulaney,"So, Mr. Mulaney, how many times a day are you urinating?"
4271,fail,Mulaney,Oh.
4272,fail,Mulaney,"Um Crazy, right?"
4273,fail,Mulaney,But what can you do?
4274,fail,Mulaney,"Anyway, Doctor, sometimes, on airplanes, I've been W-wait, hold on, you're urinating 11 times a day?"
4275,fail,Mulaney,Was that too many times to say?
4276,fail,Mulaney,Sounds like the problem could be in your prostate.
4277,fail,Mulaney,"Do me a favor, come over here Drop your pants."
4278,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, this isn't what I thought."
4279,fail,Mulaney,I should probably get going.
4280,fail,Mulaney,I have a job interview.
4281,fail,Mulaney,"Mr. Mulaney, you are peeing an alarming number of times a day."
4282,fail,Mulaney,There is no way you're leaving here without a prostate exam.

4285,fail,Mulaney,"I liked the way I was standing before, actually."
4286,fail,Mulaney,It had more dignity to it.
4287,fail,Mulaney,"All right, now, you're going to feel a little pressure."
4288,fail,Mulaney,I guess this might as well happen.
4289,fail,Mulaney,Adult life is so weird.
4290,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, and doctor, sometimes I get nervous on O-o-ohh!"
4291,fail,Mulaney,You let the Doctor do what?
4292,fail,Mulaney,Never mind.
4293,fail,Mulaney,You wouldn't understand.
4294,fail,Mulaney,"No, I wouldn't."
4295,fail,Mulaney,I don't let people put things in me.
4296,fail,Mulaney,"All right, look, what floor is Lou Cannon on?"
4297,fail,Mulaney,- 25th floor penthouse.
4298,fail,Mulaney,- Thank you.

4303,fail,Mulaney,"You're very kind, and right."
4304,fail,Mulaney,"Confidence, confidence, elegance under fire."
4305,fail,Mulaney,- Hello?

4307,fail,Mulaney,"You're all here, even the young people."
4308,fail,Mulaney,"""Hashtag."
4309,fail,Mulaney,""" - Who are you?"
4310,fail,Mulaney,- I'm John Mulaney.

4312,fail,Mulaney,"- Oh, Donna?"
4313,fail,Mulaney,"- Yes, Lou?"
4314,fail,Mulaney,"Do I have a meeting with a ""Jay Mulaylay""?"
4315,fail,Mulaney,"Yes, he's the comedian that's on the Internet."
4316,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, that one."
4317,fail,Mulaney,And do you write all those little mean things below?
4318,fail,Mulaney,"No, those are my fans."
4319,fail,Mulaney,Ah.
4320,fail,Mulaney,"You're a messy little person, ain't ya?"
4321,fail,Mulaney,"I'm sorry, I am kind of a mess today, I The subway was running late, then when I got off, on the sidewalk, there was a wheelchair just knocked over on its side with no one in it."
4322,fail,Mulaney,That's a bad thing to see.
4323,fail,Mulaney,Something happened there.
4324,fail,Mulaney,You hope it was a miracle But probably not.
4325,fail,Mulaney,"Hey, finally throwing out your ex-boyfriend's stuff."
4326,fail,Mulaney,"I'm proud of you, girl."
4327,fail,Mulaney,"Well, I was going to burn it, but that would be too romantic."
4328,fail,Mulaney,When did he leave this stuff?
4329,fail,Mulaney,You always stayed over there.
4330,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, no, no, no."
4331,fail,Mulaney,"This is stuff I took from him, you know, to make him a better, less embarrassing person."
4332,fail,Mulaney,A person the new girlfriend gets to enjoy while I get no credit.
4333,fail,Mulaney,"I mean, look at this."
4334,fail,Mulaney,A hoodie vest?
4335,fail,Mulaney,A statue of Buddha?
4336,fail,Mulaney,"I'm sorry, you're from Maryland and you yell at video games, you're not a Buddhist."
4337,fail,Mulaney,"Okay, okay, okay, let's just show some respect, please."
4338,fail,Mulaney,This hoodie vest is tight.
4339,fail,Mulaney,Now if I could only un-remember his email password.
4340,fail,Mulaney,"""Guyritchie5."
4341,fail,Mulaney,""" Let me change his email password, and I won't tell you what it is."
4342,fail,Mulaney,"Ah, I got something too."
4343,fail,Mulaney,I will pry it out of you.
4344,fail,Mulaney,- Try me.
4345,fail,Mulaney,- I'll show you my butt.
4346,fail,Mulaney,That's the password!
4347,fail,Mulaney,"Johnny Do people call you ""Johnny""?"
4348,fail,Mulaney,'Cause they shouldn't.
4349,fail,Mulaney,"John I'm gonna make a speech, and I want you to listen to me."
4350,fail,Mulaney,I am 45 years old.
4351,fail,Mulaney,"And I have an Emmy award, and when you put it against to this mirror, it looks like I have two Emmy awards."
4352,fail,Mulaney,Two Emmys and a Daytime Tony.
4353,fail,Mulaney,"Now, John, I can show you how to get where I am, that is, if you're ready to learn."
4354,fail,Mulaney,"Honestly, Mr. Cannon, I have been very anxious lately that I'm almost 30 and I've never had a real job in comedy, and if you give me the chance to work for you, sir, I promise I can do an excellent job."
4355,fail,Mulaney,Aw.
4356,fail,Mulaney,That sincerity will take you right to the middle.
4357,fail,Mulaney,"Donna, he's hired."

4362,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, my God, are you serious?"
4363,fail,Mulaney,That would be incredible.
4364,fail,Mulaney,"Yeah, yeah, it'd be a big deal for you."
4365,fail,Mulaney,Yeah.
4366,fail,Mulaney,It's for the Marsha Foundation.
4367,fail,Mulaney,It's a breast cancer walk I founded.
4368,fail,Mulaney,"I named it after my hairdresser, Marsha."
4369,fail,Mulaney,"Oh oh, I'm sorry."
4370,fail,Mulaney,Did she pass away?
4371,fail,Mulaney,"No, she wasn't even sick."
4372,fail,Mulaney,I just thought she'd get a kick out of it.
4373,fail,Mulaney,Hey!
4374,fail,Mulaney,Guess who's working for Lou Cannon?
4375,fail,Mulaney,You got the job?
4376,fail,Mulaney,Young mula!
4377,fail,Mulaney,"- Come here, man."
4378,fail,Mulaney,- Yeah.
4379,fail,Mulaney,Aw!
4380,fail,Mulaney,All right.
4381,fail,Mulaney,"Yeah, it's really cool."
4382,fail,Mulaney,I can finally tell my parents that my jokes are gonna be on TV.
4383,fail,Mulaney,"Hey, did you mention my name?"
4384,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, of course, we talked about you the whole time."
4385,fail,Mulaney,"Mulaney, that old guy from across the hall, he came by looking for you."
4386,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, Oscar, that's right."
4387,fail,Mulaney,I'm supposed to fill his humidifiers.
4388,fail,Mulaney,"He has one in the bedroom and one in the living room, and they're really deep, so you have to fill them up in the bathtub."
4389,fail,Mulaney,"God, we're all just gonna die one day."
4390,fail,Mulaney,"Anyway, I'm sure he'll understand you're busy now."
4391,fail,Mulaney,"Yeah, speaking of, Motif, can you help me out?"
4392,fail,Mulaney,"I was supposed to do a spot on that Hudson River Cruise Show next week, but now I gotta work for Lou."
4393,fail,Mulaney,Can you fill in for me?
4394,fail,Mulaney,75 bucks.
4395,fail,Mulaney,"Yeah, no problem, man."
4396,fail,Mulaney,It'll give me a chance to sell my new t-shirts.
4397,fail,Mulaney,Bah!
4398,fail,Mulaney,"""Problem bitch."
4399,fail,Mulaney,""" Like the joke you haven't written yet?"
4400,fail,Mulaney,No doubt.
4401,fail,Mulaney,"I have bad news, guys."
4402,fail,Mulaney,It's Andre.
4403,fail,Mulaney,It's Andre.
4404,fail,Mulaney,Why is he here?
4405,fail,Mulaney,I can't just stop by without telling you?
4406,fail,Mulaney,"No, that is not how drug dealers work."
4407,fail,Mulaney,- What's her problem?
4408,fail,Mulaney,"- Oh, she's just going through a break-up."
4409,fail,Mulaney,"Also, you're very unpleasant."
4410,fail,Mulaney,"Jane, you are single?"
4411,fail,Mulaney,- Too close.
4412,fail,Mulaney,- Okay.
4413,fail,Mulaney,"You know, I don't plan on selling weed forever."
4414,fail,Mulaney,"As soon as my grandma dies and my parents die, I'm coming into quite a bit of money."
4415,fail,Mulaney,"Jane, you should have Andre change Dustin's email password."
4416,fail,Mulaney,"Good idea, because then, if I want to find out what it is, I'll have to talk to Andre, - which I'd never do."
4417,fail,Mulaney,- Which you'd never do.
4418,fail,Mulaney,"John Mulaney, where do you come from?"
4419,fail,Mulaney,What's your background?
4420,fail,Mulaney,"Do you have family, siblings?"
4421,fail,Mulaney,I actually have two sisters.
4422,fail,Mulaney,They live back in Chicago with my mom and my It's a yes or no question.
4423,fail,Mulaney,"Come on, let's get to work."
4424,fail,Mulaney,Absolutely.
4425,fail,Mulaney,I know you have a taping today.
4426,fail,Mulaney,I stayed up last night and wrote a lot of jokes.
4427,fail,Mulaney,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down."
4428,fail,Mulaney,"Normally, I don't work with writers, so I think first you have to learn how to write for my voice, okay?"
4429,fail,Mulaney,"Like, I'm very smart, but it doesn't mean I can't be silly."
4430,fail,Mulaney,"I like fast, fast, fast setups and slow punch lines."
4431,fail,Mulaney,"Like, a good joke for me would be ""Bwah, bwah."
4432,fail,Mulaney,""" Like, there's a joke I did in my one-man show, ""Divorce and other aphrodisiacs."
4433,fail,Mulaney,""" - Did you ever see it?"
4434,fail,Mulaney,"- I'm sorry, I didn't, actually."
4435,fail,Mulaney,"Okay, good, well, I'll perform it from the beginning for you."
4436,fail,Mulaney,"Black stage, spot on me."
4437,fail,Mulaney,"By the time I hit puberty, I knew I was in trouble."
4438,fail,Mulaney,"The year, 1982."
4439,fail,Mulaney,"- The city, Duluth."
4440,fail,Mulaney,"- _ ""you did good, kid."
4441,fail,Mulaney,"I think you're going places,"" the club owner said to me."
4442,fail,Mulaney,All I could do is smile.
4443,fail,Mulaney,"Blackout, end of show."
4444,fail,Mulaney,"Okay, so you go on in three minutes."
4445,fail,Mulaney,Do you want to read my jokes?
4446,fail,Mulaney,"Oh John, I don't need you to write jokes for me, I really don't."
4447,fail,Mulaney,- Then what am I doing here?
4448,fail,Mulaney,"- Oh, that's funny."
4449,fail,Mulaney,"""What am I doing here""?"
4450,fail,Mulaney,I'll use that.
4451,fail,Mulaney,"Hey, we're really vibing, huh?"
4452,fail,Mulaney,"And if it wasn't for me, you'd be stuck bombing on that cruise show tonight."
4453,fail,Mulaney,"See, everyone knows a problem bitch."
4454,fail,Mulaney,"If you don't know one, then you are the problem bitch."
4455,fail,Mulaney,"Yeah, I never write anything."
4456,fail,Mulaney,Lou just talks at me for hours.
4457,fail,Mulaney,It's like he's trying to torture me and I'm his best friend.
4458,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, I miss my sorority."
4459,fail,Mulaney,"Well, at least you're getting to open for him - at this ""Marsha"" thing."
4460,fail,Mulaney,"- Yeah, it is a big show."
4461,fail,Mulaney,"What are you doing here, by the way, 'cause I know it's not to support me."
4462,fail,Mulaney,"I know, right?"
4463,fail,Mulaney,"No, Dustin lives on this street."
4464,fail,Mulaney,- Ugh!
4465,fail,Mulaney,"- No, no, no, it's good, John."
4466,fail,Mulaney,I came here to get closure.
4467,fail,Mulaney,"You know, let him see that I've moved on."
4468,fail,Mulaney,I'm doing a walk-a-thon.
4469,fail,Mulaney,"I mean, would a woman with nothing in her life immerse herself in charity work?"
4470,fail,Mulaney,"Eh, maybe she would."
4471,fail,Mulaney,Yeah.
4472,fail,Mulaney,"All right, I'm gonna walk by his window one last time."
4473,fail,Mulaney,Have fun.
4474,fail,Mulaney,-Hello?
4475,fail,Mulaney,"- John, it's Donna, Lou Cannon's assistant."
4476,fail,Mulaney,"- Hi, Donna, how are you?"
4477,fail,Mulaney,- Blessed.
4478,fail,Mulaney,So Lou has a special announcement he wants you to read to get the crowd warmed up.
4479,fail,Mulaney,No problem.
4480,fail,Mulaney,"All right, everybody."
4481,fail,Mulaney,Who's ready to laugh?
4482,fail,Mulaney,Yeah!
4483,fail,Mulaney,I can't hear you.
4484,fail,Mulaney,"That's not true, of course, but cheer louder."
4485,fail,Mulaney,Yeah.
4486,fail,Mulaney,Okay.
4487,fail,Mulaney,"""Lou Cannon cannot be here today, so there will be no show""!"
4488,fail,Mulaney,What?
4489,fail,Mulaney,"""But good news for only $25, you can take a V. I. P. Photo with Lou's cardboard replica."
4490,fail,Mulaney,""" What the hell just happened?"
4491,fail,Mulaney,"Hey, John."
4492,fail,Mulaney,"Hey, Lou."
4493,fail,Mulaney,- What's with the dirt?
4494,fail,Mulaney,- I yanked these flowers - out of Dustin's window box.
4495,fail,Mulaney,- What?
4496,fail,Mulaney,I planted them last year.
4497,fail,Mulaney,He and his new girlfriend think they get to enjoy them?
4498,fail,Mulaney,"Uh, yeah, no."
4499,fail,Mulaney,They're mine!
4500,fail,Mulaney,"- Jane, I thought you wanted closure."
4501,fail,Mulaney,"- I wanted justice, white boy, and I am one step closer."
4502,fail,Mulaney,"- Oh, my God, Dustin's home."
4503,fail,Mulaney,"- Oh, God."
4504,fail,Mulaney,I gotta hit the bricks.
4505,fail,Mulaney,Oh scatter!
4506,fail,Mulaney,"Hey, I need that lapel mic back."
4507,fail,Mulaney,I can't remember the last time I've been this humiliated.
4508,fail,Mulaney,- Undo your belt a little and bend over.
4509,fail,Mulaney,- Sure thing.
4510,fail,Mulaney,"Not on your hands, on your elbows."
4511,fail,Mulaney,Now I can remember.
4512,fail,Mulaney,"I'm sorry Lou canceled on you, man."
4513,fail,Mulaney,I'm having a rough week too.
4514,fail,Mulaney,"I sold out of my ""problem bitch"" t-shirts."
4515,fail,Mulaney,"You sold 150 t-shirts that say ""problem bitch""?"
4516,fail,Mulaney,It was that cruise.
4517,fail,Mulaney,I knew my jokes could conquer land but sea?
4518,fail,Mulaney,So what's wrong?
4519,fail,Mulaney,I don't have an ending for that joke yet.
4520,fail,Mulaney,"""Problem bitch"" is out there in the Zeitgeist now, and I figure I have an 18-hour window before people realize they're laughing at nothing."
4521,fail,Mulaney,You guys.
4522,fail,Mulaney,"You guys, listen to this email Dustin sent his new girlfriend."
4523,fail,Mulaney,Bad news.
4524,fail,Mulaney,""" Ah!"
4525,fail,Mulaney,Okay.
4526,fail,Mulaney,"""So, psycho"" That's me."
4527,fail,Mulaney,"""Showed up today and ripped out the flowers she planted."
4528,fail,Mulaney,""" That I planted."
4529,fail,Mulaney,He gave me the credit.
4530,fail,Mulaney,Listen.
4531,fail,Mulaney,New girl writes back and says he should call the cops.
4532,fail,Mulaney,"He says, and I quote, ""relax."
4533,fail,Mulaney,""" She tells him he has no balls."
4534,fail,Mulaney,"Then he writes, ""do you know what you are?"
4535,fail,Mulaney,"""A problem bitch."
4536,fail,Mulaney,"I almost miss Jane, because crazy calms down, but a problem bitch is forever."
4537,fail,Mulaney,""" - My joke has an ending!"
4538,fail,Mulaney,- And I have closure!
4539,fail,Mulaney,- Life is okay!
4540,fail,Mulaney,Come here!
4541,fail,Mulaney,- We did it!
4542,fail,Mulaney,Hello.
4543,fail,Mulaney,How did you even read that email?
4544,fail,Mulaney,I thought that Andre had the password.
4545,fail,Mulaney,He did.
4546,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, yuck."
4547,fail,Mulaney,"But then she begged me for it, John."
4548,fail,Mulaney,"She said she'd do anything, and I said, ""very well, let me hang out at your apartment."
4549,fail,Mulaney,""" Oh, I should have asked for more."
4550,fail,Mulaney,"Hello, Donna."
4551,fail,Mulaney,"No, don't worry, you're not on speaker."
4552,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, you prefer to be?"
4553,fail,Mulaney,Okay.
4554,fail,Mulaney,"Hi, John."
4555,fail,Mulaney,Lou wants to see you.
4556,fail,Mulaney,He has another job for you.
4557,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, what happened?"
4558,fail,Mulaney,Did cardboard Lou kill an escort?
4559,fail,Mulaney,"I know it's hard, John."
4560,fail,Mulaney,I was a writer too before I got promoted.
4561,fail,Mulaney,I'm not confident now.
4562,fail,Mulaney,I was confident when I was a kid.
4563,fail,Mulaney,"Like, I'm straight, but I was definitely gay when I was a little boy."
4564,fail,Mulaney,A lot of little boys are gay.
4565,fail,Mulaney,"You know, they're very flowy and they have strong opinions on things."
4566,fail,Mulaney,"I don't mean that I was a sexually active gay man when I was a child, that's not what I'm saying."
4567,fail,Mulaney,"I was more like a 70-year-old gay man who's kind of over it sexually, you know?"
4568,fail,Mulaney,I was like an old Queen.
4569,fail,Mulaney,"Like, I would go out to recess and be like, ""everyone get outta my way."
4570,fail,Mulaney,I just wanna sit here and feed my birds.
4571,fail,Mulaney,""" The gym teacher would tell me to play kick ball, and I'd be like, ""you want me to do what""?"
4572,fail,Mulaney,"- Oh, hello."
4573,fail,Mulaney,"- Hi, Oscar."
4574,fail,Mulaney,I'm giving the fern a time-out.
4575,fail,Mulaney,He's being a real diva today.
4576,fail,Mulaney,You don't look so good.
4577,fail,Mulaney,Come in and have some tea.
4578,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, Oscar, I'd love to, but I have to get back to my dream job."
4579,fail,Mulaney,"Nonsense, come in for tea."
4580,fail,Mulaney,"I pay $80 a month for this apartment, and I want people to enjoy it."
4581,fail,Mulaney,Thanks.
4582,fail,Mulaney,"Wait, you pay $80 a month?"
4583,fail,Mulaney,I know.
4584,fail,Mulaney,So what's this new job?
4585,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, I'm writing for this big comedian now."
4586,fail,Mulaney,Do you know Lou Cannon?
4587,fail,Mulaney,Is he the one that's Jon Stewart?
4588,fail,Mulaney,- No.
4589,fail,Mulaney,- I love Jon Stewart.
4590,fail,Mulaney,Yeah.
4591,fail,Mulaney,So how's the job?
4592,fail,Mulaney,"Honestly, Oscar, it's bad."
4593,fail,Mulaney,"I thought that working for Lou was gonna change things for me, but so far, the whole experience has been pointless."
4594,fail,Mulaney,Mm.
4595,fail,Mulaney,I don't like that.
4596,fail,Mulaney,Let me show you something.
4597,fail,Mulaney,Have some tea.
4598,fail,Mulaney,See this Turkish tea tray?
4599,fail,Mulaney,I got it on a business trip during my Wall Street days.
4600,fail,Mulaney,I didn't know that you worked on Wall Street.
4601,fail,Mulaney,That's where my bicycle shop was.
4602,fail,Mulaney,"Anyway, I went to Turkey to cut a deal for some banana seat covers."
4603,fail,Mulaney,Turns out the dealer was a crook!
4604,fail,Mulaney,"But while I was there, I found this amazing tea tray."
4605,fail,Mulaney,Do you fully see what I mean?
4606,fail,Mulaney,"Not really, but you talking is very relaxing."
4607,fail,Mulaney,"Well, I'll never regret my trip to Turkey because I got something valuable out of it."
4608,fail,Mulaney,"Now, this job of yours may be a drag, but you have to find out if there's a tea tray in it for you."
4609,fail,Mulaney,But what if I can't find a tea tray?
4610,fail,Mulaney,Then quit.
4611,fail,Mulaney,"And when you quit, make a scene."
4612,fail,Mulaney,"Every time I quit a job, they had to call the cops."
4613,fail,Mulaney,I adore cops.
4614,fail,Mulaney,Just airbrush under the eyes and neck.
4615,fail,Mulaney,I want to keep it natural.
4616,fail,Mulaney,There you go.
4617,fail,Mulaney,"Thanks, see you later."
4618,fail,Mulaney,Lou.
4619,fail,Mulaney,"Oh, good, you are here."
4620,fail,Mulaney,We need a stand-in for the rehearsal.
4621,fail,Mulaney,The male stand-in is late.
4622,fail,Mulaney,Just go over there and act masculine.
4623,fail,Mulaney,I'm not gonna be a stand-in.
4624,fail,Mulaney,I'm a writer.
4625,fail,Mulaney,And we need to talk about this.
4626,fail,Mulaney,I need to know if there's anything in this job for me.
4627,fail,Mulaney,"Well, let's hash it out."
4628,fail,Mulaney,Rehearsal's up.

6046,fail,Rob,Just mentally preparing myself.

6048,fail,Rob,"I mean, you said this wasn't going to be a big deal."
6049,fail,Rob,And it isn't.
6050,fail,Rob,"Look, marrying you is the biggest thing I've ever done without telling my parents first."
6051,fail,Rob,I don't want them to think I screwed up.
6052,fail,Rob,Why would they think that?
6053,fail,Rob,"They won't, honey."
6054,fail,Rob,-Just let me do the talking.
6055,fail,Rob,-Okay.
6056,fail,Rob,And don't tell them how old you are.
6057,fail,Rob,-Fine.

6083,fail,Rob,That that was a joke.
6084,fail,Rob,"I mean I mean, of course, this is a big family because you're all Catholic."
6085,fail,Rob,You don't you don't use protection.

6090,fail,Rob,"I feel like I'm at, like, a Julio Iglesias concert or something."
6091,fail,Rob,"I mean, when are you going to tell them we got married?"
6092,fail,Rob,That's kind of why we're here.
6093,fail,Rob,We've got to ease them into the idea that I'm not a little girl anymore who will just do anything they say.
6094,fail,Rob,"-Margarita, come to the kitchen."
6095,fail,Rob,"-SÃ­, Mami."
6096,fail,Rob,Don't leave me.

6105,fail,Rob,"Also, uh, I'm a big supporter of, uh, immigration rights."
6106,fail,Rob,"You know, I think those anti-immigration people are lunatics."
6107,fail,Rob,-You know what they ought to do They ought to build a giant wall across the border and patrol it with cannons.
6108,fail,Rob,What?
6109,fail,Rob,I don't need any more competition.
6110,fail,Rob,-You can't just demand identification -Why not?
6111,fail,Rob,"Hey, I came here with nothing."
6112,fail,Rob,I started working at a car wash.

6114,fail,Rob,I got 100 people working for me.
6115,fail,Rob,And you make sure that they're all legal?
6116,fail,Rob,Are you kidding?
6117,fail,Rob,"Between the 100 of them, I think they have, like, three social security numbers."
6118,fail,Rob,Mmm.
6119,fail,Rob,Can you hold that for me for a second?
6120,fail,Rob,You're smoking in my house?

6254,fail,Rob,I I think we're done here.
6255,fail,Rob,We're done?
6256,fail,Rob,"Oh, so you told them we're married?"
6257,fail,Rob,"Because if you didn't, this would be a horrible time."
6258,fail,Rob,I thought there was a moment where things were going pretty good.
6259,fail,Rob,Was that before or after you humped my grandmother?
6260,fail,Rob,Actually I think it was during.
6261,fail,Rob,"Ok, too soon."
6262,fail,Rob,Not funny.
6263,fail,Rob,You're right.
6264,fail,Rob,"No, not funny."
6265,fail,Rob,This is a disaster.
6266,fail,Rob,It's the turtle all over again.
6267,fail,Rob,"Honey, I'm sorry waitwhat?"
6268,fail,Rob,When I was 10 years old my parents said I wasn't grown up enough to take care of a turtle.
6269,fail,Rob,So I went out and bought a turtle with my own money to prove them wrong about the turtle.
6270,fail,Rob,Siempre me echan en cara lo de la turtle.
6271,fail,Rob,Estoy harta de la stupid turtle.
6272,fail,Rob,"Honey, I'll be honest the only thing I caught in there was ""turtle."
6273,fail,Rob,""" So what happened?"
6274,fail,Rob,"Look, the details are not important."
6275,fail,Rob,"Well, we had to get a new dishwasher."

6277,fail,Rob,You know?
6278,fail,Rob,I'll come up with something.
6279,fail,Rob,"You know, overcoming massive screw-ups is is not new territory for me."
6280,fail,Rob,I used to have bangs.
6281,fail,Rob,So is this our first fight?
6282,fail,Rob,-I guess it is.
6283,fail,Rob,-So what happens now?
6284,fail,Rob,I guess this is the part where we go home and have make-up sex.
6285,fail,Rob,I just humped your grandmother an hour ago.
6286,fail,Rob,I am not a machine!
6287,fail,Rob,Okay.
6288,fail,Rob,"I made the tamales my mom likes, we got empanadas for my dad, a pitcher of sangria I think we're all set!"
6289,fail,Rob,-Okay.

6291,fail,Rob,"Honey, relax."
6292,fail,Rob,I got the whole evening planned out and color-coded.
6293,fail,Rob,And if at the end of the night your parents still don't like me My whole life is over.
6294,fail,Rob,"Well, I was going to say ""we still have each other"""" but that works, too, you know."
6295,fail,Rob,"I'm telling you, this is the turtle all over again."
6296,fail,Rob,"Oh, yeah, there were bits of shell in my food for weeks."
6297,fail,Rob,"Ah, ah!"
6298,fail,Rob,That's for tomorrow night's dinner.

6308,fail,Rob,Hector!
6309,fail,Rob,Do you think we didn't give her enough attention?
6310,fail,Rob,"I mean, why does she want to marry an old, short guy anyway?"

7105,fail,Allen Gregory,She's making this incredibly uncomfortable.
7106,fail,Allen Gregory,She's pretty much the worst person.
7107,fail,Allen Gregory,"Anyway, back to me."
7108,fail,Allen Gregory,"When they first called and told me I'd been nominated for a Tony Award, I said one word pass."
7109,fail,Allen Gregory,But then I realized how selfish I was being.
7110,fail,Allen Gregory,How unfair it would be to deprive you of me winning this award.
7111,fail,Allen Gregory,Does that make sense?
7112,fail,Allen Gregory,"So, to everyone here whose fantasies are fueled by my achievements, I say this: ""We did it."
7113,fail,Allen Gregory,""" Well, I did it, let's not go completely nuts, you did absolutely nothing."
7114,fail,Allen Gregory,But how about this: You were there to see me do it.
7115,fail,Allen Gregory,"Now drink up, you knuckleheads!"
7116,fail,Allen Gregory,Have a blast!
7117,fail,Allen Gregory,"It's our night, you crazies!"
7118,fail,Allen Gregory,"Chloe, where are you?"
7119,fail,Allen Gregory,"Son, we have something we need to talk to you about."
7120,fail,Allen Gregory,Jeremy has AIDS?
7121,fail,Allen Gregory,Full-blownsies?
7122,fail,Allen Gregory,That was kind of harsh.
7123,fail,Allen Gregory,No.
7124,fail,Allen Gregory,Jeremy wants to go back to work.
7125,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, to be fair, you've kind of been pressuring me to He's decided, due to his feelings of inadequacy, that it's time he pursue something for himself."
7126,fail,Allen Gregory,"Instead of just being completely useless, sure, sure."
7127,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, so this means I'm not gonna be able to homeschool you anymore, bud."
7128,fail,Allen Gregory,Uh-huh.
7129,fail,Allen Gregory,Who we bringing in?
7130,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, no one."
7131,fail,Allen Gregory,You are going to be attending elementary school actually.
7132,fail,Allen Gregory,Starting on Monday!
7133,fail,Allen Gregory,What?
7134,fail,Allen Gregory,!
7135,fail,Allen Gregory,Really putting a damper on the ol' Tony nod.
7136,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, about that Tony nomination."
7137,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, apparently they don't nominate plays that are staged in our living room."
7138,fail,Allen Gregory,"Not over, fighting 'em tooth and nail on it."
7139,fail,Allen Gregory,"So this party was all Mmm, yeah Yeah, we thought if there was a crowd around you wouldn't freak out."
7140,fail,Allen Gregory,Yeah.
7141,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well you thought wrong, my man."
7142,fail,Allen Gregory,"Damn it, Jeremy!"
7143,fail,Allen Gregory,Ruined everything!
7144,fail,Allen Gregory,You hunk!
7145,fail,Allen Gregory,You're so handsome and stupid!
7146,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, Richard?"
7147,fail,Allen Gregory,"I'm not sure, but it seemed like Allen Gregory didn't react positively to the school idea."
7148,fail,Allen Gregory,I can keep tutoring him.
7149,fail,Allen Gregory,I don't mind.
7150,fail,Allen Gregory,"Jeremy, you need to get a job."
7151,fail,Allen Gregory,Why?
7152,fail,Allen Gregory,Are we in trouble financially?
7153,fail,Allen Gregory,No.
7154,fail,Allen Gregory,"Okay, so if there are no money problems It has nothing to do with money, Jeremy."
7155,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm a De Longpre.
7156,fail,Allen Gregory,We have money.
7157,fail,Allen Gregory,"I mean, look around-- we have expensive things."
7158,fail,Allen Gregory,Of course we have money.
7159,fail,Allen Gregory,Are you okay?
7160,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm sorry.
7161,fail,Allen Gregory,Come here.
7162,fail,Allen Gregory,"No, no, pop up here, Jerbear."
7163,fail,Allen Gregory,"Look, whether we have money problems or we don't, we'll get through it together."
7164,fail,Allen Gregory,"That makes me feel like we do, because if we didn't, there wouldn't be anything to get through?"
7165,fail,Allen Gregory,"Shh, our love is so much stronger than our steady financial decline."
7166,fail,Allen Gregory,"Wait, so there is Jeremy, stop reading into stuff."
7167,fail,Allen Gregory,You're starting to sound like the bank.
7168,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, sorry for going ballistic back there."
7169,fail,Allen Gregory,I think the whole Julie being alive thing affected me more than I thought.
7170,fail,Allen Gregory,"You know, maybe you're a little nervous about going to school."
7171,fail,Allen Gregory,"I mean, it's a big change, pal."
7172,fail,Allen Gregory,"Ugh, Jeremy, I so cannot deal with your dumb logic right now."
7173,fail,Allen Gregory,"Like, where is this job stuff even coming from?"
7174,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, where is this coming from, Jeremy?"
7175,fail,Allen Gregory,You?
7176,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, Dad, do you think the kids at school will like me?"
7177,fail,Allen Gregory,"I mean, not that I care."
7178,fail,Allen Gregory,Jeremy.
7179,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, of course they will."
7180,fail,Allen Gregory,"You are a bright, shining star."
7181,fail,Allen Gregory,They're going to love you.
7182,fail,Allen Gregory,"Thanks, Dad, and thanks, Jeremy."
7183,fail,Allen Gregory,"Ah, you're welcome."
7184,fail,Allen Gregory,For screwing up my entire life.
7185,fail,Allen Gregory,You didn't let me finish.
7186,fail,Allen Gregory,Please don't ever interrupt me again.
7187,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, that went well."
7188,fail,Allen Gregory,"Come here, you."
7189,fail,Allen Gregory,Oh I'm really exhausted.
7190,fail,Allen Gregory,"That's okay, I'll do the heavy lifting."
7191,fail,Allen Gregory,"Ya, ya."
7192,fail,Allen Gregory,"Ya, ya Ya, ya."
7193,fail,Allen Gregory,"Guys, check this."
7194,fail,Allen Gregory,My doctor says I may be able to lose the back brace in three years.
7195,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, congrats, Beth, and just in time for high school."
7196,fail,Allen Gregory,Score.
7197,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, because that brace is the only thing standing between us and sweeping popularity."
7198,fail,Allen Gregory,"Bye, Wayne."
7199,fail,Allen Gregory,"Nice new backpack, Wayne."
7200,fail,Allen Gregory,Thanks.
7201,fail,Allen Gregory,"What's the matter, Jules?"
7202,fail,Allen Gregory,You didn't say good-bye to Wayne.
7203,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, do you have an issue with Wayne?"
7204,fail,Allen Gregory,'Cause he's our best guy friend.
7205,fail,Allen Gregory,"Right, that's kind of the problem, girls."
7206,fail,Allen Gregory,"What's going on with you, Jules?"
7207,fail,Allen Gregory,You seem extra sour today.
7208,fail,Allen Gregory,"I'm sorry, I'm in a dark place and I'm taking it out on you guys."
7209,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, what's up?"
7210,fail,Allen Gregory,Talk to us.
7211,fail,Allen Gregory,"He starts school today and everyone's going to kiss his pretentious little a. Ugh, I'm gonna vomit all over myself."
7212,fail,Allen Gregory,"I'm not sure that would make you feel any better, but It wouldn't, Val, it wouldn't."
7213,fail,Allen Gregory,Then why would you do it?
7214,fail,Allen Gregory,"Okay, everyone, take your seats."
7215,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, you must be our new student, Allen De Longpre."
7216,fail,Allen Gregory,"Ah, wow."
7217,fail,Allen Gregory,"Okay, how about it's Allen Gregory?"
7218,fail,Allen Gregory,And go ahead and only address me as that from now on.
7219,fail,Allen Gregory,Thanks so much.
7220,fail,Allen Gregory,"Okay, um, welcome, please find a seat."
7221,fail,Allen Gregory,"Sure, I will, directly after I do a brief Q and A. Oh, well, we don't usually do I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name."
7222,fail,Allen Gregory,It's Ms. Winthrop.
7223,fail,Allen Gregory,"We're not in court, sweetheart, what's your first name?"
7224,fail,Allen Gregory,"Gina, but you should never call me Gina, Gina, Gina, can I see you in the hallway for a second?"
7225,fail,Allen Gregory,"Look, here's what's currently happening-- you're being difficult, and I see this whole situation running a lot smoother if you choose to cooperate."
7226,fail,Allen Gregory,"Allen Gregory, I am your teacher and I need you to respect that."
7227,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, no, no, no, no, I totally will respect that if you can respect that we are on the same exact level authority-wise."
7228,fail,Allen Gregory,"Okay, that is absolutely not the case."
7229,fail,Allen Gregory,"Great, I'll see you back in there."
7230,fail,Allen Gregory,"Also, I wouldn't lose my mind if you decided to chew a stick of gum."
7231,fail,Allen Gregory,"Thanks for understanding the sitch, Gina, you're a china doll."
7232,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, I'm Patrick."
7233,fail,Allen Gregory,You want to sit with us?
7234,fail,Allen Gregory,Are you implying you want to schedule a lunch?
7235,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, I guess."
7236,fail,Allen Gregory,"It works better for me if you say, ""Would you like to schedule a lunch""?"
7237,fail,Allen Gregory,That way I know what you're talking about.
7238,fail,Allen Gregory,"Okay, do you?"
7239,fail,Allen Gregory,"Do I what now, sweetheart?"
7240,fail,Allen Gregory,Want to have lunch?
7241,fail,Allen Gregory,"No, but I'd like to schedule a lunch when you learn how to speak English."
7242,fail,Allen Gregory,"Now, how's your Friday?"
7243,fail,Allen Gregory,'Cause mine is insane.
7244,fail,Allen Gregory,"And then I wiped all my boogers into my dad's hair, right in there."
7245,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, Patrick, was I not clear?"
7246,fail,Allen Gregory,Don't come near this table ever.
7247,fail,Allen Gregory,Who's he?
7248,fail,Allen Gregory,He's only the most popular kid in school.
7249,fail,Allen Gregory,"Ah, the two heavyweights finally meet."
7250,fail,Allen Gregory,Sure you're tired of all the buzz.
7251,fail,Allen Gregory,Allen Gregory De Longpre.
7252,fail,Allen Gregory,Joel.
7253,fail,Allen Gregory,Zadak.
7254,fail,Allen Gregory,Zadak is class president.
7255,fail,Allen Gregory,He's also the fastest at times tables.
7256,fail,Allen Gregory,4 x 5: 20.
7257,fail,Allen Gregory,Wow.
7258,fail,Allen Gregory,How does he do that?
7259,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yep, he did it again."
7260,fail,Allen Gregory,He's lead singer in the chorus.
7261,fail,Allen Gregory,"And captain of the kickball team, best at cursive."
7262,fail,Allen Gregory,It's like 8 x 6: 48.
7263,fail,Allen Gregory,It's not a big deal.
7264,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, it's not a big deal."
7265,fail,Allen Gregory,"I lobbied for fuel-cell technology on Capitol Hill, I'm friends with Sandy Bullock, really good friends."
7266,fail,Allen Gregory,Who cares?
7267,fail,Allen Gregory,"It's not a pissing contest, right, J?"
7268,fail,Allen Gregory,Did anyone catch the Charlie Rose the evening before last?
7269,fail,Allen Gregory,Did you catch it?
7270,fail,Allen Gregory,"No, nothing?"
7271,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hang on a second, ladies."
7272,fail,Allen Gregory,I think we just may have found a bigger loser than us.
7273,fail,Allen Gregory,"Good looking out, Wayne."
7274,fail,Allen Gregory,"Aw, thanks, Wayne."
7275,fail,Allen Gregory,You got it.
7276,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, just throwing out a random hypothetical to you."
7277,fail,Allen Gregory,"Let's say there's a new kid in school and on paper he should be killing it, but for some reason the other kids don't like him?"
7278,fail,Allen Gregory,Why do you think that would be?
7279,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, maybe you're just too smart for everybody."
7280,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hmm, that's a good point, Pete."
7281,fail,Allen Gregory,"You pick up on stuff, don't you?"
7282,fail,Allen Gregory,I don't know.
7283,fail,Allen Gregory,"It's Patrick, though."
7284,fail,Allen Gregory,I don't care.
7285,fail,Allen Gregory,You know what?
7286,fail,Allen Gregory,"Let's forget all the mishegas and try to enjoy our lunch, huh?"
7287,fail,Allen Gregory,Take the edge off.
7288,fail,Allen Gregory,Excuse me.
7289,fail,Allen Gregory,"Great, this train wreck."
7290,fail,Allen Gregory,What do you think you're doing?
7291,fail,Allen Gregory,Ow!
7292,fail,Allen Gregory,"It's just a little Pinot Grige at lunch, Gina."
7293,fail,Allen Gregory,Hi.
7294,fail,Allen Gregory,Hello.
7295,fail,Allen Gregory,"Mmm, that's good."
7296,fail,Allen Gregory,Let me ask you something.
7297,fail,Allen Gregory,Is it just like a complete mess down there?
7298,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm gonna level with you.
7299,fail,Allen Gregory,It's like post-Katrina.
7300,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, damn it, you're perfect."
7301,fail,Allen Gregory,"Allen Gregory, Allen Gregory."
7302,fail,Allen Gregory,Allen Gregory.
7303,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, sorry, I've just never had my breath taken away from me like that before."
7304,fail,Allen Gregory,Okay.
7305,fail,Allen Gregory,Mrs. Winthrop said you were drinking alcohol at lunch.
7306,fail,Allen Gregory,"Shh, shut up, shut up."
7307,fail,Allen Gregory,Enough about that idiot.
7308,fail,Allen Gregory,Let's talk about us.
7309,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm sorry?
7310,fail,Allen Gregory,I don't like to play games.
7311,fail,Allen Gregory,"The whole wait three days to text you, flirt with other women in front of you."
7312,fail,Allen Gregory,It's exhausting.
7313,fail,Allen Gregory,Let's just cut to the chase.
7314,fail,Allen Gregory,We're in love with each other.
7315,fail,Allen Gregory,I think you have the wrong idea.
7316,fail,Allen Gregory,"We're not going to be texting each other, we're not in love."
7317,fail,Allen Gregory,There's absolutely nothing between us.
7318,fail,Allen Gregory,There's a desk between us.
7319,fail,Allen Gregory,Okay.
7320,fail,Allen Gregory,"Pencils, papers."
7321,fail,Allen Gregory,What's that?
7322,fail,Allen Gregory,That looks like stool softener.
7323,fail,Allen Gregory,That's between us.
7324,fail,Allen Gregory,"Okay, I've had just about enough of this."
7325,fail,Allen Gregory,"Ah, me, too."
7326,fail,Allen Gregory,It's been a long day.
7327,fail,Allen Gregory,"Why don't I call Jean-Michel at Il Portofino, we'll get a table outside?"
7328,fail,Allen Gregory,"Ooh, I'm not getting a lick of service."
7329,fail,Allen Gregory,"Babe, can I hop on your land-line?"
7330,fail,Allen Gregory,Allen Gregory.
7331,fail,Allen Gregory,"What, are we dialing nine to get out?"
7332,fail,Allen Gregory,Is it nine?
7333,fail,Allen Gregory,Allen Gregory.
7334,fail,Allen Gregory,"Babe, I pick up, hit nine and then dial what?"
7335,fail,Allen Gregory,"Allen Gregory, be quiet!"
7336,fail,Allen Gregory,What was that?
7337,fail,Allen Gregory,Nothing.
7338,fail,Allen Gregory,Sounded like something.
7339,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, I should probably take off, though."
7340,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, unrelated-- is there a bidet on school grounds?"
7341,fail,Allen Gregory,Never mind.
7342,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, Joel, look-- the new kid is crying."
7343,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, I think he crapped himself."
7344,fail,Allen Gregory,I can smell it in my nose!
7345,fail,Allen Gregory,"Where you going, Allen Gregory?"
7346,fail,Allen Gregory,"There's nothing back there for me, Pat."
7347,fail,Allen Gregory,"I don't fit in either, you know."
7348,fail,Allen Gregory,But it gets easier.
7349,fail,Allen Gregory,"We almost did it, didn't we?"
7350,fail,Allen Gregory,Did what?
7351,fail,Allen Gregory,"Take care of yourself, Red."
7352,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm proud of you.
7353,fail,Allen Gregory,Mmm Your belly skin is like suede.
7354,fail,Allen Gregory,Thanks.
7355,fail,Allen Gregory,Tough but soft.
7356,fail,Allen Gregory,Like a man.
7357,fail,Allen Gregory,Man on a hunt for a job.
7358,fail,Allen Gregory,"Yeah, I'm looking."
7359,fail,Allen Gregory,It's hard out there.
7360,fail,Allen Gregory,But you'll have one soon?
7361,fail,Allen Gregory,"I mean, not that there's any rush."
7362,fail,Allen Gregory,Just want you to feel good about you-- immediately.
7363,fail,Allen Gregory,Oh!
7364,fail,Allen Gregory,I wish we could make money off your belly skin!
7365,fail,Allen Gregory,Um can someone please just sign my permission slip?
7366,fail,Allen Gregory,"Julie, there she is!"
7367,fail,Allen Gregory,What did you do today?
7368,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, let's see I went to school, I got a permission slip, I asked you to sign it, you talked about which parts of Jeremy feel like suede."
7369,fail,Allen Gregory,You go to school?
7370,fail,Allen Gregory,How fun is that?
7371,fail,Allen Gregory,!
7372,fail,Allen Gregory,You need anything else?
7373,fail,Allen Gregory,A snack?
7374,fail,Allen Gregory,You know you can help yourself to anything in the fridge.
7375,fail,Allen Gregory,"Okay, thanks."
7376,fail,Allen Gregory,"All right, well go get 'em."
7377,fail,Allen Gregory,She's great.
7378,fail,Allen Gregory,Oh!
7379,fail,Allen Gregory,Allen Gregory?
7380,fail,Allen Gregory,"Are you okay, my boy angel?"
7381,fail,Allen Gregory,I have a broken heart.
7382,fail,Allen Gregory,And undergarments filled with my own unruly waste.
7383,fail,Allen Gregory,Who did this to you?
7384,fail,Allen Gregory,Possibly the most ravishing gal I've ever seen.
7385,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, who is she?"
7386,fail,Allen Gregory,"Jeremy, please!"
7387,fail,Allen Gregory,"Seriously, Jeremy!"
7388,fail,Allen Gregory,Why don't you go sprint and grab us a couple of Oranginas?
7389,fail,Allen Gregory,So who is she?
7390,fail,Allen Gregory,She's an older girl at school.
7391,fail,Allen Gregory,How old is she?
7392,fail,Allen Gregory,Eight?
7393,fail,Allen Gregory,Nine?
7394,fail,Allen Gregory,I'd say she's comfortably in her late 60s.
7395,fail,Allen Gregory,Mm-hmm.
7396,fail,Allen Gregory,So what's the problem?
7397,fail,Allen Gregory,I don't know.
7398,fail,Allen Gregory,"I mean, she rambled on and on about how she's the principal and I'm a student."
7399,fail,Allen Gregory,What?
7400,fail,Allen Gregory,!
7401,fail,Allen Gregory,"Here we go Oh, thanks, Jeremy."
7402,fail,Allen Gregory,I guess we'll just drink these without pita chips.
7403,fail,Allen Gregory,Dad they're animals.
7404,fail,Allen Gregory,I refuse to go back to that place.
7405,fail,Allen Gregory,What?
7406,fail,Allen Gregory,!
7407,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, no, no, no, you don't mean that."
7408,fail,Allen Gregory,"Pita chips Jeremy, enough with the pita chips!"
7409,fail,Allen Gregory,Get our jackets!
7410,fail,Allen Gregory,"Don't worry, Allen Gregory."
7411,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm gonna take care of this.
7412,fail,Allen Gregory,Hey.
7413,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, my God, you scared the crap out of me, Julie!"
7414,fail,Allen Gregory,I thought you were a rat.
7415,fail,Allen Gregory,"You're not quitting school, are you?"
7416,fail,Allen Gregory,"Julie, I know you're extremely jealous of me and that manifests itself in moments like this, but I'm really fragile right now."
7417,fail,Allen Gregory,"You know, you're 100% right."
7418,fail,Allen Gregory,I am so jealous.
7419,fail,Allen Gregory,Of what?
7420,fail,Allen Gregory,Tell me.
7421,fail,Allen Gregory,Be specific.
7422,fail,Allen Gregory,"I mean, you've only been in school half a day and everyone's already talking about you."
7423,fail,Allen Gregory,"Who, Zadak?"
7424,fail,Allen Gregory,Joel Zadak?
7425,fail,Allen Gregory,Sure.
7426,fail,Allen Gregory,"Ah, I'll miss that guy."
7427,fail,Allen Gregory,But you have to go back.
7428,fail,Allen Gregory,Don't deprive these kids of the role model they deserve.
7429,fail,Allen Gregory,Is there anything I can do to help?
7430,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, I guess maybe you could pack up your belongings All right."
7431,fail,Allen Gregory,and go back to wherever the hell you came from.
7432,fail,Allen Gregory,Does that make sense?
7433,fail,Allen Gregory,"So, it does make sense?"
7434,fail,Allen Gregory,No?
7435,fail,Allen Gregory,"Mr. and Mr. De Longpre, I'm so glad you called."
7436,fail,Allen Gregory,"As superintendent of the school board, I want to personally apologize to you both."
7437,fail,Allen Gregory,It's terrible that Allen Gregory's first day wasn't a pleasurable experience.
7438,fail,Allen Gregory,We feel very lucky to have a De Longpre here at Feldstein.
7439,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, we appreciate that."
7440,fail,Allen Gregory,Shh.
7441,fail,Allen Gregory,"Thank you, Mr. Rossmyre."
7442,fail,Allen Gregory,What can I do to get him back in here?
7443,fail,Allen Gregory,"You name it, you got it."
7444,fail,Allen Gregory,Cartay blanchay.
7445,fail,Allen Gregory,"Wow, that is so nice of you."
7446,fail,Allen Gregory,"I have to say, we were surprised that Principal Gottlieb wasn't more accommodating."
7447,fail,Allen Gregory,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
7448,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, for God's sake, he's a child I'm not gonna date him."
7449,fail,Allen Gregory,"Judy, first of all, calm yourself down."
7450,fail,Allen Gregory,I was just about to suggest that.
7451,fail,Allen Gregory,This is personal stuff between you and Allen Gregory De Longpre.
7452,fail,Allen Gregory,"Whether you're gonna date him, you're not gonna date him, there's an age difference, I don't care."
7453,fail,Allen Gregory,It's none of my business.
7454,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, my God."
7455,fail,Allen Gregory,"Uh, uh, Judy, let me finish."
7456,fail,Allen Gregory,"Now, whatever you want to do on your own time, I'll look the other way."
7457,fail,Allen Gregory,"But inside these walls, you two are going to have to put your personal desires aside and act professionally."
7458,fail,Allen Gregory,"The other parents can't know, the faculty can't No one's gonna know because it's not happening!"
7459,fail,Allen Gregory,Nice.
7460,fail,Allen Gregory,That's what you should say.
7461,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm not just saying it.
7462,fail,Allen Gregory,Even better.
7463,fail,Allen Gregory,Sold me.
7464,fail,Allen Gregory,You feel good?
7465,fail,Allen Gregory,I want you to feel good.
7466,fail,Allen Gregory,Good here.
7467,fail,Allen Gregory,Jer?
7468,fail,Allen Gregory,- I'm good.
7469,fail,Allen Gregory,- I'm not.
7470,fail,Allen Gregory,I really hope you can persuade Allen Gregory to return.
7471,fail,Allen Gregory,"And, Gottlieb, for God's sake, try to keep it in your pants!"
7472,fail,Allen Gregory,There he is.
7473,fail,Allen Gregory,"A to the G. Hey, Carl-Trent."
7474,fail,Allen Gregory,Wait a second.
7475,fail,Allen Gregory,That's not the Allen Gregory I know.
7476,fail,Allen Gregory,What's got your bonnet full of all them bees?
7477,fail,Allen Gregory,Carl-Trent can I ask you something?
7478,fail,Allen Gregory,Have you ever not fit in?
7479,fail,Allen Gregory,"Aw, yeah."
7480,fail,Allen Gregory,Let me drop something on ya.
7481,fail,Allen Gregory,"Back in L. A. , they came to me and asked, ""What do you think of David Boreanaz for Bones""?"
7482,fail,Allen Gregory,They came to you for that?
7483,fail,Allen Gregory,"I was shocked, too!"
7484,fail,Allen Gregory,Considering my sordid history with the sisters Deschanel.
7485,fail,Allen Gregory,"I was like, ""Boreanaz""?"
7486,fail,Allen Gregory,I didn't see it.
7487,fail,Allen Gregory,But I was the only one.
7488,fail,Allen Gregory,And I felt that isolation.
7489,fail,Allen Gregory,So I took myself off the project.
7490,fail,Allen Gregory,You walked away.
7491,fail,Allen Gregory,"I ran, AG."
7492,fail,Allen Gregory,I ran.
7493,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, Allen Gregory."
7494,fail,Allen Gregory,There you are.
7495,fail,Allen Gregory,"We talked to Principal Gottlieb, she's come to her senses, everything's coolio."
7496,fail,Allen Gregory,"You can go back, Jeremy can get that job, train back a-chuggin'."
7497,fail,Allen Gregory,"Thanks, but that's all in the past."
7498,fail,Allen Gregory,"I've taken time to reflect on things, and I'm not going back."
7499,fail,Allen Gregory,"Rich, can I have a moment alone with our son?"
7500,fail,Allen Gregory,For what?
7501,fail,Allen Gregory,I just want to talk to him.
7502,fail,Allen Gregory,Mm-hmm.
7503,fail,Allen Gregory,About what?
7504,fail,Allen Gregory,About the situation.
7505,fail,Allen Gregory,What are you gonna say?
7506,fail,Allen Gregory,I don't know exactly.
7507,fail,Allen Gregory,I just want to talk to him.
7508,fail,Allen Gregory,About what again?
7509,fail,Allen Gregory,Please?
7510,fail,Allen Gregory,Just five minutes?
7511,fail,Allen Gregory,You got three.
7512,fail,Allen Gregory,Can I ask you something?
7513,fail,Allen Gregory,"If you're over the whole Gottlieb thing, then why aren't you gonna go back?"
7514,fail,Allen Gregory,Julie mentioned the other kids were kind of rough on you.
7515,fail,Allen Gregory,Does that have anything to do with it?
7516,fail,Allen Gregory,Did she also mention that she sucks and doesn't know what the hell she's talking about?
7517,fail,Allen Gregory,"Uh, no, she didn't mention that."
7518,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, there you go."
7519,fail,Allen Gregory,"Allen Gregory five years ago, I was a straight man."
7520,fail,Allen Gregory,"I had a wife, two kids, rock solid career."
7521,fail,Allen Gregory,I was happier than I had ever been.
7522,fail,Allen Gregory,"And then one day, I had a meeting with a potential client."
7523,fail,Allen Gregory,"He was an older gay man, and we had a connection-- a strictly platonic one, given my lifelong heterosexuality-- but, uh, he wouldn't take no for an answer."
7524,fail,Allen Gregory,"He persisted, he followed me everywhere, gave me flowers, gifts."
7525,fail,Allen Gregory,"He believed, deep within his heart, that we were destined to be together."
7526,fail,Allen Gregory,"And you started to believe it, too?"
7527,fail,Allen Gregory,Uh.
7528,fail,Allen Gregory,"The point is, Allen Gregory, that all the obstacles-- you know, me being straight as an arrow, my wife and kids, the restraining orders-- they were irrelevant."
7529,fail,Allen Gregory,"In the end, he got what he wanted."
7530,fail,Allen Gregory,"Because you see, son Don't call me ""son."
7531,fail,Allen Gregory,""" Sorry about that."
7532,fail,Allen Gregory,He didn't give up.
7533,fail,Allen Gregory,"If you want those kids to accept you, you just got to convince them that they want that, too."
7534,fail,Allen Gregory,Jeremy?
7535,fail,Allen Gregory,Thanks.
7536,fail,Allen Gregory,You're welcome.
7537,fail,Allen Gregory,I saw what you did.
7538,fail,Allen Gregory,And I can't tell you how much it meant to me.
7539,fail,Allen Gregory,You are my hero.
7540,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, that means a lot to me."
7541,fail,Allen Gregory,Sauna.
7542,fail,Allen Gregory,"No one in there, we could probably go towel-less."
7543,fail,Allen Gregory,I sign off on it.
7544,fail,Allen Gregory,"Thanks, Carl-Trent."
7545,fail,Allen Gregory,What's going on?
7546,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, Pat."
7547,fail,Allen Gregory,"What are you doing, Allen Gregory?"
7548,fail,Allen Gregory,You broke my window.
7549,fail,Allen Gregory,"Well, it's the middle of the night, silly."
7550,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm not gonna ring the doorbell.
7551,fail,Allen Gregory,Use your head.
7552,fail,Allen Gregory,"Sorry, but, um, what's so important?"
7553,fail,Allen Gregory,"Patrick, I wanted you to be the first to know."
7554,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm coming back to school tomorrow.
7555,fail,Allen Gregory,"Okay, but I feel like that could have waited till tomorrow?"
7556,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm returning to Feldstein Elementary for the long haul.
7557,fail,Allen Gregory,"Patrick, is everything all right?"
7558,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm gonna head out.
7559,fail,Allen Gregory,I'll see you tomorrow.
7560,fail,Allen Gregory,Wait.
7561,fail,Allen Gregory,"Get some sleep, you rascal."
7562,fail,Allen Gregory,Don't be up too late.
7563,fail,Allen Gregory,What?
7564,fail,Allen Gregory,I'm gonna be in so much trouble!
7565,fail,Allen Gregory,"But it's worth it, isn't it?"
7566,fail,Allen Gregory,Is it?
7567,fail,Allen Gregory,Allen Gregory we are so proud of you.
7568,fail,Allen Gregory,Gyna.
7569,fail,Allen Gregory,"Hey, so walk me through what happened yesterday."
7570,fail,Allen Gregory,"I remember your pants were clean but then later, you were running out crying like a baby, and they weren't clean."
7571,fail,Allen Gregory,What happened in the middle there?
7572,fail,Allen Gregory,"Oh, you're hilarious."
7573,fail,Allen Gregory,"No, that wasn't me."
7574,fail,Allen Gregory,It wasn't you?
7575,fail,Allen Gregory,Then who the hell was it?
7576,fail,Allen Gregory,It was an ill-advised mix of strip mall Thai food and cheap coffee.
7577,fail,Allen Gregory,"It came on so fast, by the time it hit me it was too late."
7578,fail,Allen Gregory,"I crapped myself, and I apologize."
7579,fail,Allen Gregory,It was completely unprofessional of me.
7580,fail,Allen Gregory,"And when I ran crying past Joel Zadak, his friends Ian and Guillermo-- hey, guys-- that was embarrassing, to say the least."
7581,fail,Allen Gregory,Could have sworn it was the new kid.
7582,fail,Allen Gregory,"Me, too, Guillermo."
7583,fail,Allen Gregory,"Me, too."
7584,fail,Allen Gregory,Hey.
7585,fail,Allen Gregory,You look really cute today.
7586,fail,Allen Gregory,"Listen, this is gonna be tough, I know."
7587,fail,Allen Gregory,It's gonna take some serious restraint on our part.
7588,fail,Allen Gregory,But what we have is rare.
7589,fail,Allen Gregory,Super spesh.
7590,fail,Allen Gregory,"But I'm afraid we can't act on it, Jude."
7591,fail,Allen Gregory,Please leave me alone.
7592,fail,Allen Gregory,I get it.
7593,fail,Allen Gregory,You have something on your cheek.
7594,fail,Allen Gregory,It's still there.
7595,fail,Allen Gregory,"Come on, let me."
7596,fail,Allen Gregory,No.
7597,fail,Allen Gregory,Would you stop?
7598,fail,Allen Gregory,"Just bend down, I'll get it for you."
7599,fail,Allen Gregory,There you go.
7600,fail,Hank,"""OK, stay close everyone."
7601,fail,Hank,"Our car will be here in a second"" I just hate that the whole city is watching our lives being carted away."
7602,fail,Hank,"Nobody knows it's our stuff, Tilly."
7603,fail,Hank,"Keep it moving, boys."
7604,fail,Hank,Keep it moving.
7605,fail,Hank,They're bringing the car up right now.
7606,fail,Hank,"Thank you, Don."
7607,fail,Hank,We've got a long drive to Virginia.
7608,fail,Hank,"I read about what happened to you in the papers, Mr. Pryor."
7609,fail,Hank,I'm sorry you lost your everything.
7610,fail,Hank,"That's very kind of you, don."
7611,fail,Hank,But don't feel sorry for Hank Pryor.
7612,fail,Hank,Never feel sorry for Hank Pryor.
7613,fail,Hank,You can feel sorry for the woman who lives with Hank Pryor.
7614,fail,Hank,"I'm gonna miss this place, Hank."
7615,fail,Hank,"Tilly, let me tell you again what I told the board of my company this downturn is an opportunity for us to find out what we're made of, to emerge stronger, to snatch success from the jaws of failure."
7616,fail,Hank,"You should have seen their faces, Til."
7617,fail,Hank,It killed them to fire me.
7618,fail,Hank,Bastards.
7619,fail,Hank,- Unanimous bastards.
7620,fail,Hank,- Yes.
7621,fail,Hank,It's gonna take a lot more than a hostile takeover and losing all our savings to get me down.
7622,fail,Hank,"I'm Hank Pryor, damn it."
7623,fail,Hank,"I'm gonna get us back up on top, maybe not today maybe today."
7624,fail,Hank,Maybe today.
7625,fail,Hank,There's the smile.
7626,fail,Hank,"When you first told me you wanted to move back to river bend, I sort of wanted to, I don't know, kick ya."
7627,fail,Hank,"But I mean, I did grow up there, and now there's a part of me that's looking forward to the move."
7628,fail,Hank,- Of course.
7629,fail,Hank,Of course.
7630,fail,Hank,- Not a big part.
7631,fail,Hank,"Come on, though."
7632,fail,Hank,River be where better to rise from the ashes than where I opened the very first Pryor sporting goods 170 stores ago?
7633,fail,Hank,"- Yeah, it's also where you met me."
7634,fail,Hank,"- That, too."
7635,fail,Hank,"That, too."
7636,fail,Hank,There goes our mattress.
7637,fail,Hank,We've had many an exciting evening on the old girl?
7638,fail,Hank,"Not lately, but still."
7639,fail,Hank,- Who's that with Madelyn?
7640,fail,Hank,- Spencer.
7641,fail,Hank,Spencer?
7642,fail,Hank,"Well, they've been dating for five months, Hank."
7643,fail,Hank,He looks like an idiot.
7644,fail,Hank,Is he an idiot?
7645,fail,Hank,"Henry, honey, that's dangerous."
7646,fail,Hank,Excited I am.
7647,fail,Hank,Undertaking a grand adventure are we.
7648,fail,Hank,Why is the boy talking like that?
7649,fail,Hank,What?
7650,fail,Hank,"It's Yoda, Hank."
7651,fail,Hank,Yoda's his hero.
7652,fail,Hank,"What, the kung fu frog from ""Star Wars"" is his hero?"
7653,fail,Hank,"That boy needs me, Tilly."
7654,fail,Hank,"Now that I'm no longer a slave to that damn company, I've got a chance to be a real hands-on dad."
7655,fail,Hank,This is an opportunity for us to start over as a family.
7656,fail,Hank,Team Pryor.
7657,fail,Hank,"Yeah, you know, I guess, in a way, we're lucky."
7658,fail,Hank,We're blessed.
7659,fail,Hank,"If you and I weren't us, i'd wish we were."
7660,fail,Hank,There's our car.
7661,fail,Hank,"Children, let's go!"
7662,fail,Hank,Consuela arrivederci.
7663,fail,Hank,"-= 101 =- ""Pilot"" VO By : Â¤AkaÂ¤ Team Subs-Addicts"" This is lovely."
7664,fail,Hank,"Trees, grass it's like we're living in Central Park."
7665,fail,Hank,Which was our other option.
7666,fail,Hank,I'm kidding.
7667,fail,Hank,Here we go.
7668,fail,Hank,"This Is exactly what we needed to simplify, get back to basics."
7669,fail,Hank,No more long walks to the kitchen.
7670,fail,Hank,The kitchen's right there.
7671,fail,Hank,"And we never knew our neighbors in New York, but here, in river bend look."
7672,fail,Hank,There he is.
7673,fail,Hank,Hello!
7674,fail,Hank,He seems like a Cheery Fellow.
7675,fail,Hank,Maybe later he'll bring us a pie.
7676,fail,Hank,Then we can bring him a shirt.
7677,fail,Hank,"Speaking of local flavor, my brother's gonna drop by later."
7678,fail,Hank,Probably eager to welcome us back to his tax bracket.
7679,fail,Hank,- Mom!
7680,fail,Hank,Mommy!
7681,fail,Hank,"- Henry, we're in here, honey."
7682,fail,Hank,Virginia is awesome.
7683,fail,Hank,I cannot wait to go to the bathroom here.
7684,fail,Hank,"Yes, I imagine that's one of the activities we'll all enjoy."
7685,fail,Hank,"Sweetheart, why don't you go out and check out the backyard?"
7686,fail,Hank,I'll bet you there's tons of fun stuff out there that you and your daddy can do together.
7687,fail,Hank,Maybe later we can go out and throw a baseball.
7688,fail,Hank,At what?
7689,fail,Hank,I hope there's a shed.
7690,fail,Hank,I need a place for my secret projects.
7691,fail,Hank,"He's an odd little duck, isn't he?"
7692,fail,Hank,Oh My God.
7693,fail,Hank,It's like a horror film in here.
7694,fail,Hank,"At least in a horror film, the pretty girl dies."
7695,fail,Hank,Even the stove is trying to make a run for it.
7696,fail,Hank,"Mom, why does god hate us?"
7697,fail,Hank,Honey - I don't know.
7698,fail,Hank,- Tilly.
7699,fail,Hank,"Madelyn, why don't you just give a chance?"
7700,fail,Hank,"I think you'll soon be saying what your mother and I are saying ""Yes, we can."
7701,fail,Hank,""" You can't use that."
7702,fail,Hank,That's Obama's thing.
7703,fail,Hank,"He owns those words, does he?"
7704,fail,Hank,"You know, my high school baseball team had the same slogan on our run to the state finals Yes, we can."
7705,fail,Hank,"Ultimately, of course, we couldn't."
7706,fail,Hank,But Not because of me.
7707,fail,Hank,I hit.
7708,fail,Hank,500 for the series.
7709,fail,Hank,"That is such a great story, daddy."
7710,fail,Hank,Tell it again.
7711,fail,Hank,Fine.
7712,fail,Hank,"You don't want me to say ""Yes, we can""?"
7713,fail,Hank,I'll do the President one better.
7714,fail,Hank,"I say, yes, we will."
7715,fail,Hank,"Yeah, because you're better than him."
7716,fail,Hank,He's the President.
7717,fail,Hank,- I could have been president.
7718,fail,Hank,"- Yeah, right."
7719,fail,Hank,"This is America, young lady."
7720,fail,Hank,A rich white man has just as much a chance of being President as anybody else.
7721,fail,Hank,What the hell was that?
7722,fail,Hank,Consuela!
7723,fail,Hank,"Oh, right."
7724,fail,Hank,"Hank, now that you're gonna be spending some time at home, and it looks like you're actually gonna try to speak to the children, why don't you let me tell you a little bit about them?"
7725,fail,Hank,Please.
7726,fail,Hank,"Okay, go ahead."
7727,fail,Hank,"For example, with Maddie, whenever I say anything to her I don't ask myself, ""how is Maddie going to react""?"
7728,fail,Hank,"I ask myself, ""how is moody going to react""?"
7729,fail,Hank,Trust me.

7743,fail,Hank,At pryor corp.
7744,fail,Hank,", we attacked challenges as a team."
7745,fail,Hank,Now every team needs a leader.
7746,fail,Hank,"Fortunately for us, we have me."
7747,fail,Hank,I am assigning each of you one room to unpack.
7748,fail,Hank,Our goal to climb into our beds this evening so that we may sleep soundly with the satisfaction of a job well done.

7759,fail,Hank,"- Right, that should go - That goes in the family room."
7760,fail,Hank,Thank.

7765,fail,Hank,The living room?
7766,fail,Hank,W need a living room and a family room?
7767,fail,Hank,That sounds a little silly.
7768,fail,Hank,"I mean, not silly."
7769,fail,Hank,Not silly.
7770,fail,Hank,"Just I was I was hoping that that room could be my office, my office/study."
7771,fail,Hank,"Well, it's gonna be the family room, so sorry/no."
7772,fail,Hank,There they are!
7773,fail,Hank,Hyre we go.

7790,fail,Hank,"Yes, a little housewarming."
7791,fail,Hank,I was gonna get you a bottle of champagne.
7792,fail,Hank,"Then I thought, Grady."
7793,fail,Hank,Probably don't want to remind 'em of the good life right now.
7794,fail,Hank,- Very thoughtful of you.
7795,fail,Hank,- Yes.
7796,fail,Hank,Thank you for the 5-pack.
7797,fail,Hank,"Yeah, I thought I'd drop by."
7798,fail,Hank,Just gotta check on one of my crews out on a kitchen remodel job a little bit later.
7799,fail,Hank,I'm sorry.
7800,fail,Hank,I didn't mean to bring up work in front of you.
7801,fail,Hank,Shoot.
7802,fail,Hank,Shoot!
7803,fail,Hank,"It's all right, Grady."
7804,fail,Hank,I've got a few irons in the fire.
7805,fail,Hank,Damn it!
7806,fail,Hank,Do you have to enjoy this so much?
7807,fail,Hank,The heart wants what the heart wants.
7808,fail,Hank,"How you doing, Matilda?"
7809,fail,Hank,I've been worried about you up there in Fancy Town.
7810,fail,Hank,It's been a really rough three months.

7812,fail,Hank,"Listen, Hank, if there's anything I can do for you in your time of need and failure, let me know."
7813,fail,Hank,I want to be with you in your darkest hour.
7814,fail,Hank,"Something tells me if it's our darkest hour, you'll be around."
7815,fail,Hank,This fell off the banister earlier.
7816,fail,Hank,You think you can fix it?
7817,fail,Hank,Sure.
7818,fail,Hank,Got a lot of little things to fix around here.
7819,fail,Hank,I'll just put it on the list.
7820,fail,Hank,List?
7821,fail,Hank,"So what, you recommend that we buy a house that needs work, and you're a building contractor?"
7822,fail,Hank,What a wonderful coincidence for you.
7823,fail,Hank,"Don't worry about it, Hank."
7824,fail,Hank,I'll give you a family discount 5%.
7825,fail,Hank,There you are.
7826,fail,Hank,There is no running out on a family meeting.

7835,fail,Hank,That's a toughie.
7836,fail,Hank,"Yes, it is."
7837,fail,Hank,"Thank you for noticing, uncle Grady."
7838,fail,Hank,"Honey, come on."
7839,fail,Hank,Let me handle this.
7840,fail,Hank,"Now listen up, Moody maddie."
7841,fail,Hank,- Did you call me Moody?
7842,fail,Hank,"- No, I didn't."
7843,fail,Hank,I think you did.
7844,fail,Hank,Moody.
7845,fail,Hank,"Moody maddie is that, like, what you call me behind my back?"
7846,fail,Hank,"No, it's just what your mother no!"
7847,fail,Hank,It is good to have you back.
7848,fail,Hank,So you think I'm Moody?
7849,fail,Hank,You don't like all my moods?
7850,fail,Hank,"- No, honey, I love all your moods."
7851,fail,Hank,- So you do think I have moods.
7852,fail,Hank,- That everybody has moods.
7853,fail,Hank,- Fine.
7854,fail,Hank,You know what?
7855,fail,Hank,"I'm just gonna have one mood from now, then you can't call me Moody anymore."
7856,fail,Hank,This is my only mood!
7857,fail,Hank,Problem solved.
7858,fail,Hank,I cannot believe you called her Moody and then pointed the finger right at me.
7859,fail,Hank,Is that your idea of team Pryor?
7860,fail,Hank,"Well, I'm sorry."
7861,fail,Hank,Never should have put that ridiculous Moody Maddie thing into my head.
7862,fail,Hank,It is not ridiculous.
7863,fail,Hank,You know what's ridiculous?
7864,fail,Hank,This family meeting.
7865,fail,Hank,The children and I are not your employees.
7866,fail,Hank,"Of course not, but can't we all pull together as a family and do as I say?"
7867,fail,Hank,Excuse me?
7868,fail,Hank,We can't get this mattress up the stairs.
7869,fail,Hank,- They're too narrow.
7870,fail,Hank,- What?
7871,fail,Hank,But that's our bed.
7872,fail,Hank,"Well, then you're sleeping downstairs."
7873,fail,Hank,"Nice house you found us, Grady."
7874,fail,Hank,What are you gonna tell me next the backyard's a pet cemetery?
7875,fail,Hank,"Don't worry about it, Hank."
7876,fail,Hank,I can have my guys widen those stairs.
7877,fail,Hank,- By tonight?
7878,fail,Hank,- No.
7879,fail,Hank,"Tell you what, I'll loan you Kyle's old fire truck bed for tonight."
7880,fail,Hank,"And, what the hell?"
7881,fail,Hank,I'll take that king-size jobber off your hands.
7882,fail,Hank,"Let's go, boys."
7883,fail,Hank,"Kyle, time to hit the road!"
7884,fail,Hank,I just found your mom an anniversary present.
7885,fail,Hank,This is not right.
7886,fail,Hank,Hank.
7887,fail,Hank,"Come on, honey."
7888,fail,Hank,It's just a mattress.
7889,fail,Hank,"It's not just the mattress, Tilly."
7890,fail,Hank,It's everything.
7891,fail,Hank,"I don't get an office, my children don't listen to me and I cannot climb into bed and sleep with the satisfaction of a job well done because the job has not been done and I have no bed!"
7892,fail,Hank,You're breathing on me.
7893,fail,Hank,What?
7894,fail,Hank,Your breath it's all over me.
7895,fail,Hank,"Well, this is how I sleep, Hank."
7896,fail,Hank,"- Well, this is how I sleep."
7897,fail,Hank,"- Well, then get used to my breath."
7898,fail,Hank,Fine!
7899,fail,Hank,I know that you are purposely sticking your butt into my stomach.
7900,fail,Hank,- It doesn't bother me.
7901,fail,Hank,- Good.
7902,fail,Hank,"I'm glad it doesn't bother you, that how it's gonna be all night."
7903,fail,Hank,- Good.
7904,fail,Hank,- Good.
7905,fail,Hank,You like it?
7906,fail,Hank,All night?
7907,fail,Hank,You like it?
7908,fail,Hank,You like it?
7909,fail,Hank,Yes.
7910,fail,Hank,What?
7911,fail,Hank,I like it.
7912,fail,Hank,"It's like we're poor now, and all we have is our bodies."
7913,fail,Hank,- I'm so sorry about today.
7914,fail,Hank,"- I'm sorry, too."
7915,fail,Hank,- It was so stressful.
7916,fail,Hank,"- It was a stressful, stressful day But now it's the night."
7917,fail,Hank,Honey You can have that back room for your office.
7918,fail,Hank,Gosh.
7919,fail,Hank,"Thanks, Til."
7920,fail,Hank,It's probably for the best.
7921,fail,Hank,That way I can get away.
7922,fail,Hank,Get away?
7923,fail,Hank,- From what?
7924,fail,Hank,"- No, I mean out of the way."
7925,fail,Hank,"I mean, out of your way, out of the kids' way."
7926,fail,Hank,I was in the way.
7927,fail,Hank,Does your pj's have a-a little drawstring or something?
7928,fail,Hank,"So what, you want to go back to the way things were before you actually had to spend time with your family?"
7929,fail,Hank,Good news.
7930,fail,Hank,I got it.
7931,fail,Hank,Unbelievable.
7932,fail,Hank,"One day with us, you're ready to climb out a window."
7933,fail,Hank,Admit it.
7934,fail,Hank,You like the idea of being around me and the kids more than actually being - around me and the kids.
7935,fail,Hank,- How dare you!
7936,fail,Hank,"That is absolutely okay, here's the thing."
7937,fail,Hank,"Look You're just so darn good with the kids, and Frankly, I felt like I was intruding on that today, so, yes, I think it would be better if I got myself set up in my office/study and focused on the Business/money side of things."
7938,fail,Hank,"Hank, you know, I didn't love having you around today either, but I am not doing this on my own."
7939,fail,Hank,I can't.
7940,fail,Hank,"I know it may not seem like it, but I am freaking out here!"
7941,fail,Hank,"No, I get that."
7942,fail,Hank,You're are not backing out on me.
7943,fail,Hank,I'm used to having help.
7944,fail,Hank,I've always had Consuela.
7945,fail,Hank,"Well, guess what."
7946,fail,Hank,"You're Consuela now, buddy!"
7947,fail,Hank,So what?
7948,fail,Hank,I'm just supposed to completely forget about getting a job?
7949,fail,Hank,"Look, I am not going back to the way things used to be."
7950,fail,Hank,You have got to be a part of this family.
7951,fail,Hank,I am a part of this family.
7952,fail,Hank,There's nothing the world more important to me than you and the children.
7953,fail,Hank,- Mommy?
7954,fail,Hank,"- Not now, Henry."
7955,fail,Hank,"I mean, hello."
7956,fail,Hank,Come in.
7957,fail,Hank,"What can I do for you, my son?"
7958,fail,Hank,I can't sleep.
7959,fail,Hank,I'm pretty sure there's a ghost in my room.
7960,fail,Hank,- Dad?
7961,fail,Hank,- What?
7962,fail,Hank,Me.
7963,fail,Hank,Of course.
7964,fail,Hank,"Come on, henry."
7965,fail,Hank,"Let's, tuck you back in to bedand we can talk."
7966,fail,Hank,To each other?
7967,fail,Hank,That's the plan.
7968,fail,Hank,I think one of the ghosts was ringing a bell.
7969,fail,Hank,Rest assured there'll be no more bell ringing tonight.
7970,fail,Hank,"Now, Henry, I know you like to use your imagination, and that is to be celebrated to an extent."
7971,fail,Hank,"But when that imagination becomes more of a liability than an asset, perhaps it's time to rein it in a bit."
7972,fail,Hank,You with me so far?
7973,fail,Hank,Good.
7974,fail,Hank,"Now Franklin Roosevelt once said, ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
7975,fail,Hank,""" You've heard of Roosevelt?"
7976,fail,Hank,Famous.
7977,fail,Hank,President.
7978,fail,Hank,Dead guy.
7979,fail,Hank,It's like we just lit those tuition checks on fire.
7980,fail,Hank,"You okay, Henry?"
7981,fail,Hank,"Your brother couldn't sleep, so he and I are talking."
7982,fail,Hank,To each other?
7983,fail,Hank,"Well, I mean, when Henry freaks himself out, I usually just - come in here, and we hang out."
7984,fail,Hank,- Good.
7985,fail,Hank,Hang out.
7986,fail,Hank,"How does that go, exactly?"
7987,fail,Hank,"Well, I sit on the bed."
7988,fail,Hank,Facing him.
7989,fail,Hank,Then what?
7990,fail,Hank,Then I sing to him.
7991,fail,Hank,She sings to you?
7992,fail,Hank,Really?
7993,fail,Hank,Yes.
7994,fail,Hank,I don't know what to sing.
7995,fail,Hank,It's the singing not the song.
7996,fail,Hank,"O, say can you see By the dawn's early light Very funny."
7997,fail,Hank,You're singing to an 11 year old.
7998,fail,Hank,"You are both awful, awful children."
7999,fail,Hank,- What's going on?
8000,fail,Hank,- You have given me awful children.
8001,fail,Hank,"I just got dad to sing ""the star-spangled banner."
8002,fail,Hank,""" Well, I am glad to be the family clown."
8003,fail,Hank,If this were the Pryor corporation This is the Pryor corporation now.
8004,fail,Hank,Fine.
8005,fail,Hank,I am putting the boy to bed.
8006,fail,Hank,I'm going to finish the job.
8007,fail,Hank,"If you two will excuse me Now, Hank, just so you know, henry is potty trained."
8008,fail,Hank,Good night.
8009,fail,Hank,"And, madelyn your mother didn't vote for Obama."
8010,fail,Hank,"Just so you know, that singing thing was Maddie's idea."
8011,fail,Hank,She makes me do stuff.
8012,fail,Hank,Women are good at that.
8013,fail,Hank,Why do you think we had a second House Here you go.
8014,fail,Hank,"I'll see you in the morning, Henry."
8015,fail,Hank,Can I leave light on tonight?
8016,fail,Hank,I don't know.
8017,fail,Hank,It's just this room is different.
8018,fail,Hank,Everything's different.
8019,fail,Hank,"It's a little scary having everything change, isn't it, having to start over?"
8020,fail,Hank,"I'm a little scared, too."
8021,fail,Hank,How about that?
8022,fail,Hank,Even at my age.
8023,fail,Hank,- And you're old.
8024,fail,Hank,- I'm not Old.
8025,fail,Hank,But I'm not 25.
8026,fail,Hank,- You're not 25 times 2.
8027,fail,Hank,"- Yes, I know how old I am."
8028,fail,Hank,"If you like, I could just lie down with you for a while."
8029,fail,Hank,Just when I thought they couldn't make a smaller bed.
8030,fail,Hank,"Good night, Henry."
8031,fail,Hank,"Good night, dad."
8032,fail,Hank,Dad?
8033,fail,Hank,You're breathing on me.
8034,fail,Hank,"Awful sweet, awesome Hank."
8035,fail,Hank,I just need to get a few hours sleep and then have some minor back surgery.
8036,fail,Hank,"You know, I was thinking last night that back in New York, with all the money, the nannies and the staff, we insulated ourselves from the everyday struggles and challenges of real life."
8037,fail,Hank,How great was that?
8038,fail,Hank,Just this is harder than I thought.
8039,fail,Hank,"You're Hank Pryor, damn it."
8040,fail,Hank,At lst we got each other and a 5-pack of beer.
8041,fail,Hank,What the hell is that?
8042,fail,Hank,Grady's starting to make some improvements.
8043,fail,Hank,"Yeah, this is much better."
8044,fail,Hank,I'm okay!
8045,fail,Hank,So Mr. Family decided to work instead of spending time with his son.
8046,fail,Hank,I'll put it on the list.
8047,fail,Work It,Hey.
8048,fail,Work It,Hey.
8049,fail,Work It,"Honey, how did it go?"
8050,fail,Work It,"Well, the company actually folded while I was in the interview."
8051,fail,Work It,Oh.
8052,fail,Work It,But You stole all their sugar.
8053,fail,Work It,Yeah.
8054,fail,Work It,That's not all.
8055,fail,Work It,Mm-hmm.
8056,fail,Work It,"And look, salt and pepper Ooh, hoo."
8057,fail,Work It,"We got creamer, and wait for it."
8058,fail,Work It,Mm-hmm.
8059,fail,Work It,Wait for it.
8060,fail,Work It,Uh-huh.
8061,fail,Work It,Ketchup.
8062,fail,Work It,"Ooh, hoo!"
8063,fail,Work It,"Well, it'll all come in handy 'cause you got your last unemployment check today."
8064,fail,Work It,"Oh, yeah."
8065,fail,Work It,I can't believe it's already been a year.
8066,fail,Work It,I can't either.
8067,fail,Work It,But don't worry about it.
8068,fail,Work It,"As you can see, our lifestyle doesn't have to suffer."
8069,fail,Work It,"Oh, hey, your insurance from Pontiac is about to run out, so I made an appointment for you to get a physical tomorrow."
8070,fail,Work It,"No, sweetheart, I told you Oh, no, hey."
8071,fail,Work It,"Lee, as a woman, I'm gonna have to ask you to stop comparing a prostate exam to the pinball scene in ""The Accused."
8072,fail,Work It,""" No, it's not okay."
8073,fail,Work It,"Hey, dad."
8074,fail,Work It,Hey.
8075,fail,Work It,My phone's not working.

8078,fail,Work It,"Well, let me take a look."
8079,fail,Work It,"Oh, yeah."
8080,fail,Work It,Just as I suspected.
8081,fail,Work It,I cancelled your service.
8082,fail,Work It,What?
8083,fail,Work It,"I'm sorry, Kat."
8084,fail,Work It,Would a packet of soy sauce make you feel better?
8085,fail,Work It,"Look, it's just until I find a job."
8086,fail,Work It,Okay?
8087,fail,Work It,But what am I gonna do in the meantime?
8088,fail,Work It,"Sweetie, we have a landline."
8089,fail,Work It,A landline?
8090,fail,Work It,Don't those give you brain cancer?
8091,fail,Work It,You know what?
8092,fail,Work It,"I'm just gonna have to find myself a rich, older boyfriend."
8093,fail,Work It,You and me both.
8094,fail,Work It,You and me both.
8095,fail,Work It,Check it out.
8096,fail,Work It,We're in the paper.
8097,fail,Work It,Mm.
8098,fail,Work It,"Ah, they couldn't have done it without us."
8099,fail,Work It,"Hey, don't worry about it."
8100,fail,Work It,"I'm gonna figure something out, all right."
8101,fail,Work It,You know the deal.
8102,fail,Work It,"If I'm working, you're working."
8103,fail,Work It,"Right back at ya, bro."
8104,fail,Work It,Mm-hmm.
8105,fail,Work It,"What's up, guys?"
8106,fail,Work It,"Hey, Brian."
8107,fail,Work It,"Hey, B. Did you get your last check?"
8108,fail,Work It,Yep.
8109,fail,Work It,Hard to believe.
8110,fail,Work It,"A year ago, we were sittin' pretty."
8111,fail,Work It,"St. Louis Pontiac's top salesman, head mechanic, and nearly accident-free courtesy shuttle driver."
8112,fail,Work It,Now look at us.
8113,fail,Work It,How did this happen?
8114,fail,Work It,"Well, it's a recession."
8115,fail,Work It,It's not a recession.
8116,fail,Work It,It's a mancession.
8117,fail,Work It,"Look, women are taking over the workforce."
8118,fail,Work It,"Soon, they'll start getting rid of men."
8119,fail,Work It,They'll just keep a few of us around as sex slaves.
8120,fail,Work It,That part doesn't sound so bad.
8121,fail,Work It,"Not the kind of sex you like, Angel."
8122,fail,Work It,Just kissing and cuddling and Listening.
8123,fail,Work It,"Well, I'll tell you what."
8124,fail,Work It,I'm not going down without a fight.
8125,fail,Work It,"I did hear they're hiring down at, uh, Astro Taco."
8126,fail,Work It,No!
8127,fail,Work It,That place is a dump.
8128,fail,Work It,"I mean, we still have our pride."
8129,fail,Work It,For now.
8130,fail,Work It,"When the women take over, they'll make pride illegal."
8131,fail,Work It,That and eating on the toilet.
8132,fail,Work It,"Ah, thanks, doc."
8133,fail,Work It,That prostate exam wasn't as bad as I expected.
8134,fail,Work It,Beers really took the edge off.
8135,fail,Work It,I love your bracelet.
8136,fail,Work It,It was a little present to myself.
8137,fail,Work It,"I could wait around for a guy to buy it for me, but none of them have any money."
8138,fail,Work It,Oh.
8139,fail,Work It,"So the drug business is good, uh?"
8140,fail,Work It,Bazonkers.
8141,fail,Work It,I have got more work than I can handle.
8142,fail,Work It,"In fact, if you know anyone, we are looking to hire."
8143,fail,Work It,"Uh, really?"
8144,fail,Work It,'Cause I'm a salesman and I-I happen to be between jobs.
8145,fail,Work It,"Oh, we're kind of just looking for girls."
8146,fail,Work It,Really?
8147,fail,Work It,Why?
8148,fail,Work It,"Well, we've had some guys, but the doctors seem to want to nail them less."

8194,fail,Work It,The results it's been getting in nonpartisan clinical trials are just stunning.

8573,fail,We Are Men,You have to go through the five stages of grief.
8574,fail,We Are Men,"Hey, everybody."

8596,fail,We Are Men,""" I'd say it's more like a way station for guys who just got divorced, dumped, or are otherwise incapable of buying their own couch."
8597,fail,We Are Men,"Like Frank Russo, a successful clothing manufacturer."
8598,fail,We Are Men,"After 16 years of marriage, he and his wife had grown apart."
8599,fail,We Are Men,I hate you!
8600,fail,We Are Men,Are you insane?
8601,fail,We Are Men,!
8602,fail,We Are Men,But then Frank found true happiness with Lauren.
8603,fail,We Are Men,Then Stacy.
8604,fail,We Are Men,Then Jessica.
8605,fail,We Are Men,"After his fourth divorce, Frank vowed the next time he found ""true happiness,"" he was just going to sleep with it for a few weeks."
8606,fail,We Are Men,"Gil Bartis, small business owner."
8607,fail,We Are Men,Separated.
8608,fail,We Are Men,He and his wife were having trouble in the bedroom.
8609,fail,We Are Men,Okay.
8610,fail,We Are Men,We have 20 minutes.
8611,fail,We Are Men,Not now.
8612,fail,We Are Men,I'm bloated.
8613,fail,We Are Men,I had pizza for lunch.
8614,fail,We Are Men,"That's okay, we can do it from the side."
8615,fail,We Are Men,I'll do all the work.
8616,fail,We Are Men,"Oh, I don't want you to touch me."
8617,fail,We Are Men,"Gil, I'm home!"
8618,fail,We Are Men,"Oh, my God!"
8619,fail,We Are Men,His wife caught him having the world's worst affair.
8620,fail,We Are Men,He moved here temporarily until he could convince his wife to take him back.
8621,fail,We Are Men,That was a year and a half ago.
8622,fail,We Are Men,"Yeah, she has nothing to do with the story."
8623,fail,We Are Men,I just thought she deserved a moment.
8624,fail,We Are Men,"Well, she gave me chlamydia once."
8625,fail,We Are Men,See if she wants half of that back!
8626,fail,We Are Men,Dr. Stuart Weber.
8627,fail,We Are Men,"Stuart fell madly in love with a young divorce attorney who, it turns out, was very good at her job."
8628,fail,We Are Men,"Next time, he fell for a more spiritual woman, who, on their honeymoon in Paris, developed a taste for the material world and a distaste for her new husband."
8629,fail,We Are Men,"Six months later, she hired the most ruthless lawyer in town."
8630,fail,We Are Men,But Stuart was smarter this time.
8631,fail,We Are Men,"He's living here, hiding his assets until a settlement is reached."
8632,fail,We Are Men,"Unfortunately, not all of his assets."
8633,fail,We Are Men,"Truth is, after being here for a few weeks, I was feeling a little less lonely."
8634,fail,We Are Men,It was nice being around guys who knew what I was going through and could be sensitive to that.
8635,fail,We Are Men,She's a whore!
8636,fail,We Are Men,"Time to move on, son."
8637,fail,We Are Men,Where do you stand on Asian women?
8638,fail,We Are Men,You guys don't get it.
8639,fail,We Are Men,It's not that easy for me.
8640,fail,We Are Men,Sara was the only girl I've ever been with.
8641,fail,We Are Men,One?
8642,fail,We Are Men,- That's your total?
8643,fail,We Are Men,- I'm offended by it.

8646,fail,We Are Men,We met freshman orientation week on a Welcome to College hayride.
8647,fail,We Are Men,What was I supposed to do?

8649,fail,We Are Men,Semester at sea?
8650,fail,We Are Men,Internship at American Apparel?
8651,fail,We Are Men,These are just ideas.
8652,fail,We Are Men,This is a blessing.
8653,fail,We Are Men,You are a free man now.
8654,fail,We Are Men,You can finally live.
8655,fail,We Are Men,We are taking you under our wing.
8656,fail,We Are Men,- We did the same thing for Gil.
8657,fail,We Are Men,- I was here before you.
8658,fail,We Are Men,But you didn't use your time well.
8659,fail,We Are Men,"Carter, look around you."
8660,fail,We Are Men,You're living in paradise.
8661,fail,We Are Men,We got a killer gym.
8662,fail,We Are Men,We got indoor parking.
8663,fail,We Are Men,We got complimentary Sunday brunch.
8664,fail,We Are Men,And we are four exits from Hollywood.
8665,fail,We Are Men,"""Actresses"" come through here all the time."
8666,fail,We Are Men,Enter Frank stage left.
8667,fail,We Are Men,And Stuart stage right.
8668,fail,We Are Men,"Yeah, just to be clear, different actresses, different stages."
8669,fail,We Are Men,All very kosher.
8670,fail,We Are Men,"Then I stupidly went on her Facebook page, and there were all these pictures of her - with that guy."
8671,fail,We Are Men,- Why?
8672,fail,We Are Men,Why would you do that?
8673,fail,We Are Men,So you could feel bad about yourself?
8674,fail,We Are Men,You go on your wife's Facebook page all the time.
8675,fail,We Are Men,And I feel bad about myself.
8676,fail,We Are Men,I just have too much time on my hands.
8677,fail,We Are Men,"I mean, I don't even have a job anymore."
8678,fail,We Are Men,I was working for her dad.
8679,fail,We Are Men,He fired you?
8680,fail,We Are Men,This is a family of animals!
8681,fail,We Are Men,It would've been awkward anyway.
8682,fail,We Are Men,"Besides, marketing industrial paint is even more boring than it sounds."
8683,fail,We Are Men,"So, wait, what are you gonna do?"
8684,fail,We Are Men,I have no idea.
8685,fail,We Are Men,"- Come on, dig deep."
8686,fail,We Are Men,"- Well, I I guess I've always really wanted to coach basketball."
8687,fail,We Are Men,There you go.

8689,fail,We Are Men,"The other guys, they wanted to be Jordan, I wanted to be Pat Riley."
8690,fail,We Are Men,I even had a little suit.
8691,fail,We Are Men,So what made you hang up the tiny three-piece?
8692,fail,We Are Men,Sara.
8693,fail,We Are Men,She didn't even let me watch basketball.
8694,fail,We Are Men,You want to coach?

8710,fail,We Are Men,Are you kidding?
8711,fail,We Are Men,Okay.

8744,fail,We Are Men,His bride just dumped him at the altar.
8745,fail,We Are Men,Do you have to lead with that?
8746,fail,We Are Men,It's really your defining characteristic right now.

10946,fail,Saint George,To indulge.
10947,fail,Saint George,"It's okay, I'll wait."
10948,fail,Saint George,"You better not, you know?"
10949,fail,Saint George,I'm on a lot of heart medicine.
10950,fail,Saint George,And I could go like that.
10951,fail,Saint George,You're so bad!
10952,fail,Saint George,Ay!
10953,fail,Saint George,"Yo, Georgie."

10988,fail,Saint George,"Boom, it's erased."
10989,fail,Saint George,See?
10990,fail,Saint George,"Yeah, but it's not erased from my mind."
10991,fail,Saint George,Like a flaccid tootsie roll.
10992,fail,Saint George,"Yo, fool, tonight we're going to el sueno."
10993,fail,Saint George,I have to teach tonight.
10994,fail,Saint George,"""I have to teach tonight."

11003,fail,Saint George,"Look, I haven't dated out of respect for Mackenzie."
11004,fail,Saint George,You do realize that the only two women in your life is your mom and ex-wife?
11005,fail,Saint George,"Georgie, what kind of mexican are you?"
11006,fail,Saint George,You should have all kinds of kids showing up out of nowhere!
11007,fail,Saint George,With luggage!
11008,fail,Saint George,What do I want all kinds of kids for?
11009,fail,Saint George,"To help you move, to help you do the yard work, to answer the door, to get you a cigarette."
11010,fail,Saint George,"Yeah, that's what I do for daddy."
11011,fail,Saint George,Here you go.
11012,fail,Saint George,"If I dated, it would be embarrassing for Mackenzie."
11013,fail,Saint George,"I mean, you saw the way she looked at the wedding picture."
11014,fail,Saint George,"Man, she's still all in love."
11015,fail,Saint George,"Ay, Georgie."

11019,fail,Saint George,"I don't think so, bro."
11020,fail,Saint George,I've seen her out with some dudes.
11021,fail,Saint George,"What, you mean in a group, right?"
11022,fail,Saint George,"No, man."
11023,fail,Saint George,One on one.
11024,fail,Saint George,With hors D'oeuvres.
11025,fail,Saint George,"And if the dude's paying For hors d'oeuvres, he's trying to get to the bottom of it."
11026,fail,Saint George,"The fine print, Georgie."
11027,fail,Saint George,"Come on, junior, you don't think you should've told me this before?"
11028,fail,Saint George,I am telling you now.
11029,fail,Saint George,"Look, she's out there, living it up, getting it on, talking low, sitting outside."
11030,fail,Saint George,"And if they're already sitting outside, they're getting it on."
11031,fail,Saint George,"Daddy always says, if I can get 'em outside, I can get it on."
11032,fail,Saint George,That's right!
11033,fail,Saint George,Showing her toes.
11034,fail,Saint George,Showing her toes?
11035,fail,Saint George,"Ah, this guy."
11036,fail,Saint George,"You don't know nothing, do you, Georgie?"
11037,fail,Saint George,"If they're showing their toes--If they're showing their toes, it means they're letting it out!"
11038,fail,Saint George,"Letting everybody know they got no corns, bunions, inhibitions, all ten nails!"
11039,fail,Saint George,"Sometimes, on the little toe, if the nail falls off-- they just paint the skin."
11040,fail,Saint George,"Okay, have you two guys been painting cars with the garage door closed again?"
11041,fail,Saint George,"Georgie, you're a very rigid individual."
11042,fail,Saint George,You have to stop thinking about everything.
11043,fail,Saint George,You have to get out there and have some fun!
11044,fail,Saint George,"Look, Mac is out there, having fun."
11045,fail,Saint George,Showing toes.
11046,fail,Saint George,You're right.
11047,fail,Saint George,"I mean, Mackenzie's dating and I'm here at home, being insulted by my mom."
11048,fail,Saint George,That's what I'm talking about!
11049,fail,Saint George,"We're gonna get out there, and we're gonna attack it!"
11050,fail,Saint George,George!
11051,fail,Saint George,Like a bull in a doughnut shop!
11052,fail,Saint George,Yo!
11053,fail,Saint George,"Dad, have you seen my inhaler?"
11054,fail,Saint George,"Uh, yeah."
11055,fail,Saint George,Here it is.
11056,fail,Saint George,"Hey, why don't you go breathe over there?"
11057,fail,Saint George,Are you dying your hair?
11058,fail,Saint George,I'm trying a new shampoo.
11059,fail,Saint George,Shouldn't you be in the shower then?
11060,fail,Saint George,Shouldn't you be on the other side of that door then?
11061,fail,Saint George,"Harper, honey, did you find your inhaler?"
11062,fail,Saint George,Yeah.
11063,fail,Saint George,Are you dying your hair?
11064,fail,Saint George,"That's funny to you, huh?"
11065,fail,Saint George,"Hey, Harper, honey, go downstairs."
11066,fail,Saint George,I'll be down in a minute.
11067,fail,Saint George,"You know, I'm just a little prematurely gray."
11068,fail,Saint George,"At your age, it's not premature."
11069,fail,Saint George,Do you even know what you're doing?
11070,fail,Saint George,Did you read the directions?
11071,fail,Saint George,I never read the instructions.
11072,fail,Saint George,What's so hard?
11073,fail,Saint George,"You put it on, and when it stops burning, you rinse it out."
11074,fail,Saint George,"Oh, my God."
11075,fail,Saint George,Let me help.
11076,fail,Saint George,"So, you're trying to look younger."
11077,fail,Saint George,You got a hot date or something?
11078,fail,Saint George,"No, I don't have a hot date."
11079,fail,Saint George,Why?
11080,fail,Saint George,Do you have a hot date?
11081,fail,Saint George,What's that supposed to mean?
11082,fail,Saint George,"Junior told me, Mac, that you started dating."
11083,fail,Saint George,Hold on.
11084,fail,Saint George,"You're not jealous, are you?"
11085,fail,Saint George,Of what?
11086,fail,Saint George,Of you dating?
11087,fail,Saint George,"Come on, I'm a man."
11088,fail,Saint George,Men don't get jealous.
11089,fail,Saint George,Oh.
11090,fail,Saint George,So has anybody-- that's disgusting.
11091,fail,Saint George,And also it's really none of your business.
11092,fail,Saint George,So what do you do with Harper?
11093,fail,Saint George,You leave him with me while you're out there showing your toes?
11094,fail,Saint George,Showing my toes?
11095,fail,Saint George,"You really don't know anything, do you?"
11096,fail,Saint George,You know what?
11097,fail,Saint George,Forget this.
11098,fail,Saint George,You can do it yourself.
11099,fail,Saint George,"Well, fine."
11100,fail,Saint George,"Well, I'm glad you're dating again."
11101,fail,Saint George,Oh?
11102,fail,Saint George,I'm thrilled.
11103,fail,Saint George,"In fact, I think it's healthy."
11104,fail,Saint George,"Tonight, me, junior, and Tio, we're all going to el sueno."
11105,fail,Saint George,Good for you.
11106,fail,Saint George,Yeah.
11107,fail,Saint George,"And I'll probably go out the next night, the night after that, the night after that."
11108,fail,Saint George,"Then I'll probably take a night off, then I'll probably go out, like, four nights in a row."
11109,fail,Saint George,"George, do not turn this into a competition."
11110,fail,Saint George,I'm not competing.
11111,fail,Saint George,"But as soon as my scalp stops burning, it's on."
11112,fail,Saint George,All right.
11113,fail,Saint George,I hope you're ready.
11114,fail,Saint George,You have 20 minutes-- there you go-- to complete this test.
11115,fail,Saint George,Is that your Porsche Cayenne in the parking lot?
11116,fail,Saint George,Yeah.
11117,fail,Saint George,You know what it is?
11118,fail,Saint George,So what did you do?
11119,fail,Saint George,"I mean, this teaching thing's gotta be some court-ordered community service."
11120,fail,Saint George,"Oh, really?"
11121,fail,Saint George,You don't think I'm here because maybe I possibly want to be here?
11122,fail,Saint George,No.
11123,fail,Saint George,"Come on, what was it?"
11124,fail,Saint George,Is it cocaine?
11125,fail,Saint George,Weed?
11126,fail,Saint George,"How'd you get that fine new car, ese?"
11127,fail,Saint George,I beat a white kid to death.
11128,fail,Saint George,"Good luck tonight, Mr. L. What are you talking about?"
11129,fail,Saint George,I can smell your cologne from the back of the room.
11130,fail,Saint George,"Expensive suit, shoes all shined, new hair-- You look hot."
11131,fail,Saint George,"That's inappropriate, young lady."
11132,fail,Saint George,"Ay, papi!"
11133,fail,Saint George,There is something about you tonight.
11134,fail,Saint George,I think it's in the air.
11135,fail,Saint George,Or it could be me.
11136,fail,Saint George,I'm very hormonal right now.
11137,fail,Saint George,"Georgie, hey!"
11138,fail,Saint George,Let's go.

11144,fail,Saint George,I'm George's uncle.
11145,fail,Saint George,"I'm George's boss, Concepcion."
11146,fail,Saint George,I never realized such beauty walked the halls of this particular institution.
11147,fail,Saint George,"Yeah, well, you went to the pet shop once and tried to buy Mickey Mouse."
11148,fail,Saint George,"Please, tell me if I'm being too gallant."
11149,fail,Saint George,You're being too gallant.
11150,fail,Saint George,"Not you, stupid."

11156,fail,Saint George,"Man, look at homegirl's wearing the hell out of that dress."
11157,fail,Saint George,She sure is.

11159,fail,Saint George,"Ay, I'm so bad!"
11160,fail,Saint George,"Come on, let's go."
11161,fail,Saint George,"Tio, you were right, There are some fine women here tonight."

11216,fail,Saint George,What are you talking about?
11217,fail,Saint George,This stuff burns.
11218,fail,Saint George,Pepper spray doesn't work on you?
11219,fail,Saint George,My daddy doesn't succumb to pain.

11273,fail,Saint George,That's True.
11274,fail,Saint George,We never would've met if I hadn't talked to you first.
11275,fail,Saint George,"I saw you coming over to me, and I was like, ""Oh, my god, please, don't come over here and talk to me."

11285,fail,Saint George,You're gonna tell me how to approach a woman?
11286,fail,Saint George,Yes.
11287,fail,Saint George,"Listen, the reason you're so awkward around women is that you still feel like this: A shy, 10-year-old mexican boy."
11288,fail,Saint George,"You know, women, they pick up on this stuff, George."
11289,fail,Saint George,"Yeah, can women pick up when a man doesn't want to have a conversation anymore?"
11290,fail,Saint George,You're not Alma's little boy anymore.

11293,fail,Saint George,See?
11294,fail,Saint George,"So show women that side, huh?"
11295,fail,Saint George,The confident you.
11296,fail,Saint George,"You know, and then if you're not too scared, you can show 'em some of that tenderness you like to hide from everybody."
11297,fail,Saint George,That's what I fell in love with.
11298,fail,Saint George,"Who knows, maybe you'll fool 'em long enough to-- Hee-Hoo, Hee-Hoo."
11299,fail,Saint George,Sa-Sass!
11300,fail,Saint George,Twice?
11301,fail,Saint George,Forget it.
11302,fail,Saint George,Why don't you come have a drink with me and my friends?
11303,fail,Saint George,"No, you go have fun with your friends."
11304,fail,Saint George,I'm okay.
11305,fail,Saint George,All right.
11306,fail,Saint George,"Hey, Chloe."
11307,fail,Saint George,I want to buy that lady right there a drink.
11308,fail,Saint George,"All right, old man."
11309,fail,Saint George,"Oh, hey."
11310,fail,Saint George,He's on the bathroom floor with his eyes swollen shut.
11311,fail,Saint George,You can't miss him.
11312,fail,Saint George,He's the one without tear ducts.
11313,fail,Saint George,Hi.
11314,fail,Saint George,Are you alone?
11315,fail,Saint George,I am alone.
11316,fail,Saint George,Would you care to join me?
11317,fail,Saint George,Thank you for the drink.
11318,fail,Saint George,You're welcome.
11319,fail,Saint George,That's a-- That's a beautiful dress.
11320,fail,Saint George,Thank you.
11321,fail,Saint George,It's new.
11322,fail,Saint George,My hair's new.
11323,fail,Saint George,It was a lot grayer this morning.
11324,fail,Saint George,I think it looks great.
11325,fail,Saint George,Cheers.
11326,fail,Saint George,Cheers.
11327,fail,Saint George,"Beat it, bitch."
11328,fail,Saint George,"I'm right here, and I've been drinking."
11329,fail,Saint George,"Why don't you go over there before you get hurt, huh?"
11330,fail,Saint George,What the hell are you doing?
11331,fail,Saint George,"Oh, you so bad, papi!"
11332,fail,Saint George,I got your picture!
11333,fail,Saint George,"You sexted me, tigre!"
11334,fail,Saint George,What?
11335,fail,Saint George,I didn't sext you.
11336,fail,Saint George,Liar.
11337,fail,Saint George,"I was charging my phone, and look what popped up."
11338,fail,Saint George,Bam!
11339,fail,Saint George,Whoo!
11340,fail,Saint George,"Okay, that's not me."
11341,fail,Saint George,"Well, there's only one way to prove it."
11342,fail,Saint George,"Like Cinderella, see if it fits."
11343,fail,Saint George,And if it doesn't fit better.
11344,fail,Saint George,Ay Mijo!
11345,fail,Saint George,"Mijo, don't lose me, mijo."
11346,fail,Saint George,You're the wind beneath my arms.
11347,fail,Saint George,"Georgie, they're taking my daddy to the cedars."
11348,fail,Saint George,You know what?
11349,fail,Saint George,I better go with them.
11350,fail,Saint George,"You know, they're family."
11351,fail,Saint George,They don't have I. D. One of them is undocumented.
11352,fail,Saint George,"I'm gonna take my drink, though."
11353,fail,Saint George,"Hello, ladies."
11354,fail,Saint George,Is everything to your satisfaction?
11355,fail,Saint George,"Ay, you so bad."
11356,fail,Saint George,"Ooh, it grows."
11357,fail,Saint George,Oy.
11358,fail,Saint George,Whoo.
11359,fail,Saint George,What are you watching?
11360,fail,Saint George,You came home alone?
11361,fail,Saint George,Figures.
11362,fail,Saint George,You gotta tell them you got money.
11363,fail,Saint George,That's how old guys like you get girls.
11364,fail,Saint George,"Listen, I am a successful latino businessman, okay?"
11365,fail,Saint George,There are lots of girls that would love to be in a relationship with me.
11366,fail,Saint George,Can I tell you something and you won't get mad?
11367,fail,Saint George,Probably not.
11368,fail,Saint George,The longest relationship you've ever had is with your hand.
11369,fail,Saint George,Wha-- The other hand.
11370,fail,Saint George,"Not that it's any of your business, but I do think I'm gonna start dating again."
11371,fail,Saint George,Perfecto.
11372,fail,Saint George,"That's what the dating world needs, another fat-ass out there."
11373,fail,Saint George,You know what?
11374,fail,Saint George,I'll be all right.
11375,fail,Saint George,"You can look everywhere, but you'll never find another woman."
11376,fail,Saint George,Better than your mother.
11377,fail,Saint George,"Oh, my god, you almost had me."
11378,fail,Saint George,You-- Don't touch me with that hand!
11379,fail,Saint George,Cochino!
11380,fail,Saint George,Are these yours?
11381,fail,Saint George,Mira!
11382,fail,Crowded,"From the moment your kids are born, you dread the fact that one day they'll leave you."
11383,fail,Crowded,And then they do.
11384,fail,Crowded,And it's just as bad as you thought it'd be.
11385,fail,Crowded,I just want you to remember that you're special.
11386,fail,Crowded,And you'll always be my little girl.
11387,fail,Crowded,Two forms of birth control.
11388,fail,Crowded,"And men, are like basketball players, - they dribble before they shoot."
11389,fail,Crowded,- Martina!
11390,fail,Crowded,"It's reality, Mike."
11391,fail,Crowded,That's how we ended up with this one.
11392,fail,Crowded,"Bye, guys."
11393,fail,Crowded,I'll miss you.
11394,fail,Crowded,"Oh, I'll miss you too."
11395,fail,Crowded,"- Bye, Dad."
11396,fail,Crowded,"- Love you, kid."
11397,fail,Crowded,Love you.
11398,fail,Crowded,"Well, at least now we know what it's like."
11399,fail,Crowded,The next one will be easier.
11400,fail,Crowded,What are you looking at?
11401,fail,Crowded,"It's just us now, we're alone!"
11402,fail,Crowded,Wow.
11403,fail,Crowded,The empty nest.
11404,fail,Crowded,We're gonna die in this house.
11405,fail,Crowded,I need alcohol.
11406,fail,Crowded,"It is only 10 A. M. Well, on the other hand, we don't have to drive anybody anywhere."
11407,fail,Crowded,"Or cook anyone dinner, or set a good freakin' example."
11408,fail,Crowded,"Hey, we don't have to say ""freakin'"" anymore!"
11409,fail,Crowded,We can swear when we want.
11410,fail,Crowded,Drink when we want.
11411,fail,Crowded,Have sex when we want.
11412,fail,Crowded,Have sex when we want.
11413,fail,Crowded,There's a reason I said that twice.
11414,fail,Crowded,This could be good.
11415,fail,Crowded,This could be really good.
11416,fail,Crowded,Finally getting rid of the playroom.
11417,fail,Crowded,Turn it into a media room.
11418,fail,Crowded,"Big-ass plasma, we'll have an old-timey pop-corn machine, one of those big chairs with the cup-holders."
11419,fail,Crowded,I'll be just like a Hollywood douchebag.
11420,fail,Crowded,Hey.
11421,fail,Crowded,- I got a new Would You Rather.
11422,fail,Crowded,- Oh yeah?
11423,fail,Crowded,OK.
11424,fail,Crowded,"Would you rather have sex with Kate Upton ten minutes after she's dead, or, have sex with a live 90-year-old."
11425,fail,Crowded,I've never loved you more than I do at this moment.
11426,fail,Crowded,"So sick, yet, so perfectly balanced."
11427,fail,Crowded,Thank you.
11428,fail,Crowded,Kate Upton.
11429,fail,Crowded,"This is the perfect way to celebrate writing our last tuition check, and your dad and stepmother finally moving to Florida."
11430,fail,Crowded,The last piece to the freedom puzzle.
11431,fail,Crowded,Look what I found!
11432,fail,Crowded,That's pot!
11433,fail,Crowded,Our kids were doing drugs?
11434,fail,Crowded,Mike?
11435,fail,Crowded,- Martina?
11436,fail,Crowded,- It's your parents!
11437,fail,Crowded,Hide the pot!
11438,fail,Crowded,Wow.
11439,fail,Crowded,I just felt so young.
11440,fail,Crowded,- Bob?
11441,fail,Crowded,- What?
11442,fail,Crowded,- They're in the playroom!
11443,fail,Crowded,- What?
11444,fail,Crowded,The playroom!
11445,fail,Crowded,They're fine.
11446,fail,Crowded,"Alice, again, the key that we made for you and Dad was for emergencies."
11447,fail,Crowded,"We knocked on the door, and you didn't answer."
11448,fail,Crowded,It could have been an emergency.
11449,fail,Crowded,Why didn't you just ring the bell?
11450,fail,Crowded,Ring the bell?
11451,fail,Crowded,"Oh, child, please, we're family."
11452,fail,Crowded,Family doesn't ring the bell.
11453,fail,Crowded,"Oh, hey, Pop."
11454,fail,Crowded,"Oh, good, you're finally cleaning this room."
11455,fail,Crowded,You didn't have all these toys when you were a kid.
11456,fail,Crowded,I know.
11457,fail,Crowded,You spoiled those girls.
11458,fail,Crowded,"You know, when Mike was young, I taught him how to do military sheet corners."
11459,fail,Crowded,He couldn't go out to play until I could bounce a coin off his tightly made bed.
11460,fail,Crowded,I still get a little tense when I see a quarter.
11461,fail,Crowded,We tried to help with Stella and Shea.
11462,fail,Crowded,"Yes, you were here all the time."
11463,fail,Crowded,"Well, we're headed to the store."
11464,fail,Crowded,We'll bring you back some donuts.
11465,fail,Crowded,"Alice, we don't eat donuts."
11466,fail,Crowded,And you know I'm gluten-free.
11467,fail,Crowded,"Oh, that nonsense."
11468,fail,Crowded,That's why you're so skinny.
11469,fail,Crowded,I don't think I'm too skinny.
11470,fail,Crowded,You can't see your own skinny.
11471,fail,Crowded,It's like smelling your own breath.
11472,fail,Crowded,You need someone else to tell you that it's bad.
11473,fail,Crowded,"Mike, I'll pick you up some breath mints."
11474,fail,Crowded,When are you gonna stand up to them?
11475,fail,Crowded,"Well, I've always said ""soon""."
11476,fail,Crowded,"But now that they're moving, I can give the truthful answer: never."
11477,fail,Crowded,So what are we gonna do with this?
11478,fail,Crowded,"What if ""Horton Hears a Who""!"
11479,fail,Crowded,is real?
11480,fail,Crowded,Deep.
11481,fail,Crowded,You know what's great about smoking pot when you're older?
11482,fail,Crowded,You don't get paranoid.
11483,fail,Crowded,It's the cops!
11484,fail,Crowded,"Oh, thank God, you're home!"
11485,fail,Crowded,- Stella?
11486,fail,Crowded,- Brace yourselves.
11487,fail,Crowded,I left Justin.
11488,fail,Crowded,"I thought he was my soulmate, and now, we don't even hate the same Kardashians."
11489,fail,Crowded,"We had this big fight, and he's dead to me."
11490,fail,Crowded,"Is he dead to everyone, did you kill him?"
11491,fail,Crowded,Answer your father!
11492,fail,Crowded,What is wrong with you guys?
11493,fail,Crowded,Nothing.
11494,fail,Crowded,"I could really use a pizza, but go on."
11495,fail,Crowded,Ok.
11496,fail,Crowded,"Well, I'm here because I'm not getting any acting jobs, and my YouTube videos don't get enough hits."
11497,fail,Crowded,"And some of those comments, are so mean."
11498,fail,Crowded,"This one guy wrote, ""you're a waste of human skin, you hot-skank mess."
11499,fail,Crowded,""" I mean the ""hot"" was sweet."
11500,fail,Crowded,But the rest being an adult is hard.
11501,fail,Crowded,"Plus I miss you guys, so - I was wondering - Hello, all."
11502,fail,Crowded,Forgive the surprise.
11503,fail,Crowded,Shea?
11504,fail,Crowded,What are you doing here?
11505,fail,Crowded,- I'm moving back home.
11506,fail,Crowded,- What?
11507,fail,Crowded,But I told you I was coming here today to move back home.
11508,fail,Crowded,What?
11509,fail,Crowded,"Yes, but I reasoned that the cumulative impact on them would be reduced if it were simultaneous rather than staggered."
11510,fail,Crowded,Ew.
11511,fail,Crowded,"Shea, you don't just break into someone's scene."
11512,fail,Crowded,"We're not in a movie, Stella."
11513,fail,Crowded,This is the real world.
11514,fail,Crowded,"A world where thanks to this country's hatred of science, the funding for my job has been eliminated."
11515,fail,Crowded,"So, like 23."
11516,fail,Crowded,"8% of people between the ages of 22 and 31, I've determined the most logical course of action in this economy, is to move back in with my parents."
11517,fail,Crowded,"And because of the broad number of young people doing this, there's no longer the social stigma attached."
11518,fail,Crowded,"Though, it pains me to admit I care about such things."
11519,fail,Crowded,Is she done?
11520,fail,Crowded,I can never tell when she's done.
11521,fail,Crowded,I'm the one who should move back in.
11522,fail,Crowded,Mom and Dad are like my best friends.
11523,fail,Crowded,They're my only friends!
11524,fail,Crowded,"Girls, girls, don't fight."
11525,fail,Crowded,You're equally disappointing both of us.
11526,fail,Crowded,- Hello?
11527,fail,Crowded,We hear voices in there.
11528,fail,Crowded,"- Oh, boy."
11529,fail,Crowded,It's Grandma!
11530,fail,Crowded,Are you girls here for our anniversary dinner?
11531,fail,Crowded,"- Oh, no."
11532,fail,Crowded,I'm moving back home today.
11533,fail,Crowded,"- So am I. Oh, well, we certainly can't move to Florida now!"
11534,fail,Crowded,It looks like you need us again.
11535,fail,Crowded,Who wants donuts?
11536,fail,Crowded,They're back!
11537,fail,Crowded,They're all back!
11538,fail,Crowded,It's a nightmare.
11539,fail,Crowded,It's a [Bleep.
11540,fail,Crowded,] disaster!
11541,fail,Crowded,"Oh, god, we can't say [Bleep."
11542,fail,Crowded,] anymore.
11543,fail,Crowded,- Where are you going?
11544,fail,Crowded,- Where there's donuts.
11545,fail,Crowded,Hey.
11546,fail,Crowded,You got a passenger.
11547,fail,Crowded,Real slacker type.
11548,fail,Crowded,Sounds like my daughter's boyfriend.
11549,fail,Crowded,It is my daughter's boyfriend.
11550,fail,Crowded,"Oh, that knock."
11551,fail,Crowded,"Come in, Justin."
11552,fail,Crowded,Hey.
11553,fail,Crowded,Hey.
11554,fail,Crowded,Here's how you knock.
11555,fail,Crowded,It's not Why?
11556,fail,Crowded,Because we as a society have decided that's how you knock.
11557,fail,Crowded,What are you doing here?
11558,fail,Crowded,I miss Stella.
11559,fail,Crowded,I was hoping you'd help me get her back.
11560,fail,Crowded,"Look, Justin, no man thinks any guy is good enough for his little girl."
11561,fail,Crowded,"And then I met you, and please don't take this the wrong way, but I thought, he's not even close."
11562,fail,Crowded,"I mean, do you even have a job?"
11563,fail,Crowded,I have something better than a job.
11564,fail,Crowded,An idea for an app.
11565,fail,Crowded,Everybody with the apps.
11566,fail,Crowded,"Man, it's awesome."
11567,fail,Crowded,"But figuring out how to actually make it, super hard."
11568,fail,Crowded,"Look, that's the problem with people your age, once it gets hard, you quit."
11569,fail,Crowded,You gotta stick with things.
11570,fail,Crowded,I like that.
11571,fail,Crowded,Could you text that to me?
11572,fail,Crowded,Get out.
11573,fail,Crowded,What happens if I push this button?
11574,fail,Crowded,That'll get you out even faster.
11575,fail,Crowded,Push it.
11576,fail,Crowded,A mess.
11577,fail,Crowded,"We spent so much time teaching the girls how special they are, why didn't we teach them how to shut a cabinet door?"
11578,fail,Crowded,Why do we buy free-range chicken?
11579,fail,Crowded,"I mean, how free are they really?"
11580,fail,Crowded,It's not like they're letting them walk into town.
11581,fail,Crowded,"Speaking of - freeing things - Mike, stop it."
11582,fail,Crowded,We are not asking the girls to leave.
11583,fail,Crowded,"They're hurting right now, and they need us."
11584,fail,Crowded,Ok.
11585,fail,Crowded,It's quiet.
11586,fail,Crowded,Maybe we can have the place to ourselves.
11587,fail,Crowded,- No one yelling out.
11588,fail,Crowded,- Mom?
11589,fail,Crowded,Mom?
11590,fail,Crowded,Tell Shea she's never gonna get a date with Carter if she texts like a dorky virgin.
11591,fail,Crowded,"Let me see what you wrote, honey."
11592,fail,Crowded,"""I'm interested in dating you."
11593,fail,Crowded,"Do you share similar feelings""?"
11594,fail,Crowded,- Ooh.
11595,fail,Crowded,That's bad.
11596,fail,Crowded,- I know.
11597,fail,Crowded,"But Stella wants me to text ""Hang sometime""?"
11598,fail,Crowded,I can't send that.
11599,fail,Crowded,It's a meaningless statement.
11600,fail,Crowded,"Shea, you have to put yourself out there, be sexy, and stop dressing like Doria."
11601,fail,Crowded,I've put myself out there with Carter.
11602,fail,Crowded,"Last week, he was making an AU calculation that would have been off by thousands of parsecs and I thoughtfully pointed out his mistake."
11603,fail,Crowded,That's love.
11604,fail,Crowded,Is she done?
11605,fail,Crowded,I can never tell when she's done.
11606,fail,Crowded,"- Mom, talk to her."
11607,fail,Crowded,"- Honey, you never correct a man you like."
11608,fail,Crowded,Really?
11609,fail,Crowded,Until you're married and have two daughters to back you up.
11610,fail,Crowded,"Look, men are like balloons."
11611,fail,Crowded,They don't want anyone to pop 'em and show that it's all just air inside.
11612,fail,Crowded,All you gotta do is fill that balloon with what they want to hear.
11613,fail,Crowded,It's like how for Dad you act all excited about the Mets.
11614,fail,Crowded,"Hey, I never pushed Shea to be a Mets fan."
11615,fail,Crowded,You named me after their stadium.
11616,fail,Crowded,But I love the Mets because you love them.
11617,fail,Crowded,That's my girl.
11618,fail,Crowded,"Ok, it works."
11619,fail,Crowded,"""Hang sometime""?"
11620,fail,Crowded,And send.
11621,fail,Crowded,- Thank you.
11622,fail,Crowded,- Anytime.
11623,fail,Crowded,"If you know all this, how come you can't work things out with Justin?"
11624,fail,Crowded,It's just super hard when two brilliant complex artists get together.
11625,fail,Crowded,"We're still talking about you and Justin, right?"
11626,fail,Crowded,I miss him so much.
11627,fail,Crowded,"Look, Stella, why don't you forget about boys, and focus on what you're gonna do with your life?"
11628,fail,Crowded,Maybe you're right.
11629,fail,Crowded,"I mean, I have a degree in Theater Arts."
11630,fail,Crowded,It's crazy that I'm not using it.
11631,fail,Crowded,"Oh, you're using it some."
11632,fail,Crowded,I'm a singer and an actress.
11633,fail,Crowded,- That's like having two lottery tickets.
11634,fail,Crowded,- Yes.
11635,fail,Crowded,As valuable as two lottery tickets.
11636,fail,Crowded,"Hey, let's all do something."
11637,fail,Crowded,We could watch a movie like when we were kids.
11638,fail,Crowded,Perhaps a Disney princess movie?
11639,fail,Crowded,Not Beauty and the Beast.
11640,fail,Crowded,Belle is so basic.
11641,fail,Crowded,Don't you put down Belle.
11642,fail,Crowded,She was willing to marry an animal to get a good library.
11643,fail,Crowded,I'm exhausted.
11644,fail,Crowded,I forgot how much energy parenting takes.
11645,fail,Crowded,But they like us.
11646,fail,Crowded,They really do.
11647,fail,Crowded,How do we get away from them?
11648,fail,Crowded,"A naked woman in bed with me, the only reason I ever do anything."
11649,fail,Crowded,"Lying, sneaking off to a hotel."
11650,fail,Crowded,We're like Stella in high school.
11651,fail,Crowded,No kid talk.
11652,fail,Crowded,That's the deal.
11653,fail,Crowded,"Whatever it is, they can wait 5 minutes."
11654,fail,Crowded,I mean 45 minutes.
11655,fail,Crowded,But it could be the girls.
11656,fail,Crowded,It's Shea.
11657,fail,Crowded,Carter hasn't texted back.
11658,fail,Crowded,Now it's Stella.
11659,fail,Crowded,Justin got tagged in a picture with some girl.
11660,fail,Crowded,"Oh, my poor babies."
11661,fail,Crowded,Ok.
11662,fail,Crowded,"No, no, look, you're gonna do that thing now, where you're thinking about the kids when we're about to have sex."
11663,fail,Crowded,I'm gonna be here doing some of my best work and you're gonna have this worried look in your eyes.
11664,fail,Crowded,I can't help it.
11665,fail,Crowded,A mother is only as happy as her unhappiest child.
11666,fail,Crowded,What about her unhappiest husband?
11667,fail,Crowded,"You know what, hon?"
11668,fail,Crowded,We should probably just go.
11669,fail,Crowded,Why?
11670,fail,Crowded,"Wait, that is not fair."
11671,fail,Crowded,I wanna do this.
11672,fail,Crowded,Don't you get it?
11673,fail,Crowded,The fun is over.
11674,fail,Crowded,I mean this is supposed to be our time.
11675,fail,Crowded,But it is their time again.
11676,fail,Crowded,Oh my god.
11677,fail,Crowded,You're right.
11678,fail,Crowded,This is our life now.
11679,fail,Crowded,Isn't it?
11680,fail,Crowded,There is no getting away from them.
11681,fail,Crowded,You know whose fault it is?
11682,fail,Crowded,It's ours.
11683,fail,Crowded,We did this.
11684,fail,Crowded,We made them our friends.
11685,fail,Crowded,"We were so involved in their lives, we listened, we - supported, we validated."
11686,fail,Crowded,- We blew it.
11687,fail,Crowded,Now we have to sneak off to a hotel room to get away from them?
11688,fail,Crowded,"If we'd only spanked them once, we could have saved $200."
11689,fail,Crowded,"We could have saved a boatload more if we'd done what my father did, and just left."
11690,fail,Crowded,It's too late for that.
11691,fail,Crowded,"Okay, I'm in."
11692,fail,Crowded,They got to go.
11693,fail,Crowded,- And your parents.
11694,fail,Crowded,"- All right, here's the deal."
11695,fail,Crowded,Tomorrow is their anniversary party.
11696,fail,Crowded,"We get everybody together, we tell them how much we love 'em, - and then we kick 'em to the curb."
11697,fail,Crowded,- Deal.
11698,fail,Crowded,All right.
11699,fail,Crowded,Let's get our 200 bucks worth.
11700,fail,Crowded,"Oh, this one's from Mike and Martina."
11701,fail,Crowded,I bet it's that scarf I've been hinting at.
11702,fail,Crowded,"Oh look, Bob, it's some sort of coupon."
11703,fail,Crowded,It's airline miles.
11704,fail,Crowded,"Yes, we gifted you our miles, so that when you do decide to move to Florida you can upgrade to 1st class if there's a seat available."
11705,fail,Crowded,"""If there's a seat""?"
11706,fail,Crowded,"So, we go to the airport, with no idea where we're going to sit, and then just announce ourselves like we think we're so great?"
11707,fail,Crowded,I don't think 1st class is for us.
11708,fail,Crowded,We'd be uncomfortable.
11709,fail,Crowded,But there's more room and you get to board first.
11710,fail,Crowded,But then we'd have to watch the other passengers go by us.
11711,fail,Crowded,Everybody hates those 1st class people when they walk by them.
11712,fail,Crowded,We'd be the people they hate!
11713,fail,Crowded,"Look, let's just call this a bad gift and move on."
11714,fail,Crowded,"Our gift aside, I would like to make a toast."
11715,fail,Crowded,Multi-generational events like this remind one of the natural order of things.
11716,fail,Crowded,"First you're a child, then you grow older, and eventually you leave home and stand proudly upon your own two feet taking any jobs you can, even if it's not your dream."
11717,fail,Crowded,THen you grow old and you move to Florida.
11718,fail,Crowded,Cheers.
11719,fail,Crowded,But you and Mom always told us to follow our dreams.
11720,fail,Crowded,"Yes, we did and that may have been a mistake."
11721,fail,Crowded,"See, we didn't think everybody in your generation would have the same dream, to be an actress or win singing competitions."
11722,fail,Crowded,Surely you're not equating my dream of becoming an astronaut with hoping that a chair turns around on The Voice.
11723,fail,Crowded,"Dad, what are you trying to tell us?"
11724,fail,Crowded,Clearly they want us to leave.
11725,fail,Crowded,- Is that true?
11726,fail,Crowded,"- Well, - it might be time."
11727,fail,Crowded,- Wow.
11728,fail,Crowded,- I didn't know you guys didn't want us here.
11729,fail,Crowded,- Neither did I. Sometimes I have trouble with social cues.
11730,fail,Crowded,"I was perceiving joy and you were feeling shackled, and burdened."
11731,fail,Crowded,"- No, no."
11732,fail,Crowded,"- We do not feel that way, and we want to be supportive in any way we can."
11733,fail,Crowded,"Well, that didn't take long."
11734,fail,Crowded,What is that supposed to mean?
11735,fail,Crowded,You're going soft already.
11736,fail,Crowded,You remember the summer that you turned 16?
11737,fail,Crowded,"I locked you out of the house with a bowl of cereal and the Want Ads and I said, ""don't you come home until you've got a job""."
11738,fail,Crowded,Now that's parenting.
11739,fail,Crowded,I hated you that day.
11740,fail,Crowded,"I thought to myself, ""I can't wait to get away from these people."
11741,fail,Crowded,""" See?"
11742,fail,Crowded,Success!
11743,fail,Crowded,I would never do that to my daughters!
11744,fail,Crowded,- I like them.
11745,fail,Crowded,"- Well, there's your mistake."
11746,fail,Crowded,"You love your children, you don't like them!"
11747,fail,Crowded,I wanna be close to my girls.
11748,fail,Crowded,"When I was growing up, you and Mom had no idea what was going on in my life."
11749,fail,Crowded,We weren't that interested in you.
11750,fail,Crowded,"Well, I'm not you, Dad."
11751,fail,Crowded,And I don't push my kids away when they need me.
11752,fail,Crowded,"Girls, you can stay."
11753,fail,Crowded,"You might call that weak, I call it a strong man making a strong decision."
11754,fail,Crowded,"It's okay with you, dear?"
11755,fail,Crowded,Of course.
11756,fail,Crowded,We love you.
11757,fail,Crowded,"That's good parenting, right here."
11758,fail,Crowded,"Oh, that knock!"
11759,fail,Crowded,It's Justin.
11760,fail,Crowded,"Hi, Stella, you look smokin'."
11761,fail,Crowded,"Hey, everybody."
11762,fail,Crowded,"Justin, why are you here?"
11763,fail,Crowded,I'm taking your dad's advice.
11764,fail,Crowded,- He told me I shouldn't quit on you.
11765,fail,Crowded,- I did not say that.
11766,fail,Crowded,"Well, something like that."
11767,fail,Crowded,"You never texted me, so I don't got it exactly."
11768,fail,Crowded,"But he said, if you want something, you should stick with it."
11769,fail,Crowded,And I want you.
11770,fail,Crowded,Justin I want you too.
11771,fail,Crowded,You're a full balloon and no one should pop you.
11772,fail,Crowded,I'll explain metaphor to her later.
11773,fail,Crowded,Let's go home baby.
11774,fail,Crowded,"Um, about that we kinda got evicted."
11775,fail,Crowded,"Well, you can stay here with me."
11776,fail,Crowded,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, you guys are not even married."
11777,fail,Crowded,"I hear ya, bro."
11778,fail,Crowded,"Stella, will you marry me?"
11779,fail,Crowded,"- No, no, no!"
11780,fail,Crowded,- Yes!
11781,fail,Crowded,"I should rub it in, but I just feel sorry for you."
11782,fail,Crowded,How can you drink iced lattes at this time of night?
11783,fail,Crowded,Why does that bother you?
11784,fail,Crowded,I sleep fine.
11785,fail,Crowded,It's just suspicious.
11786,fail,Crowded,- Is she really gonna marry that guy?
11787,fail,Crowded,- Oh let's don't think about that tonight.
11788,fail,Crowded,"Honey, we can keep the fun going."
11789,fail,Crowded,How about you go get some wine and I'll put on something ridiculous.
11790,fail,Crowded,Are we talking parading?
11791,fail,Crowded,"Oh, I'll parade."
11792,fail,Crowded,I love a parade.
11793,fail,Crowded,Alice sent me to make sure we're not stuck with those miles.
11794,fail,Crowded,- We'll get you another gift.
11795,fail,Crowded,"- Oh, good."
11796,fail,Crowded,Nothing crazy this time.
11797,fail,Crowded,"- Now, about our staying - Dad, go to Florida."
11798,fail,Crowded,Have fun.
11799,fail,Crowded,We really don't need your help here.
11800,fail,Crowded,"Well, don't tell your stepmom that."
11801,fail,Crowded,She was miserable about moving.
11802,fail,Crowded,"You know, it's nice to feel needed, and not just going some place warm to rot and die."
11803,fail,Crowded,"Besides, who wants to be around a lot of old people."
11804,fail,Crowded,Old people are annoying.
11805,fail,Crowded,Are they?
11806,fail,Crowded,"I know you think I'm too conservative and old-fashioned, but I did marry a black woman, that's gotta mean something."
11807,fail,Crowded,"Dad, I don't see race."
11808,fail,Crowded,"I see a bossy woman who you married, who's always in my house."
11809,fail,Crowded,Fair enough.
11810,fail,Crowded,"You know, I don't agree with how you raised these girls, but I see how much they like you."
11811,fail,Crowded,That must feel kinda good.
11812,fail,Crowded,It does.
11813,fail,Crowded,I don't think my pop even knew I existed until I was standing in his direct line of sight.
11814,fail,Crowded,"Well, he never talked to you?"
11815,fail,Crowded,Asked you how you're feeling?
11816,fail,Crowded,How you doing?
11817,fail,Crowded,Never.
11818,fail,Crowded,- Different times.
11819,fail,Crowded,"- Yeah, different times, but it would have been nice if he had, right?"
11820,fail,Crowded,Yeah.
11821,fail,Crowded,It would have been nice.
11822,fail,Crowded,"Goodnight, Son."
11823,fail,Crowded,"Goodnight, Dad."
11824,fail,Crowded,- Mike?
11825,fail,Crowded,- Yeah?
11826,fail,Crowded,"How you doin', Son?"
11827,fail,Crowded,I'm good.
11828,fail,Crowded,You?
11829,fail,Crowded,Good too.
11830,fail,Crowded,Good.
11831,fail,Crowded,Did you tell him we don't want the miles?
11832,fail,Crowded,What?
11833,fail,Crowded,- The miles!
11834,fail,Crowded,- He told me.
11835,fail,Crowded,I hope whatever you put on is easy to take off.
11836,fail,Crowded,"Hello, ladies."
11837,fail,Crowded,"Good news, honey, the girls came in to tell me that - Carter texted back."
11838,fail,Crowded,- Told you he would.
11839,fail,Crowded,"Remember, two forms of birth control, right, Mom and Dad?"
11840,fail,Crowded,I feel very uncomfortable in this conversation.
11841,fail,Crowded,Why?
11842,fail,Crowded,We're all adults here.
11843,fail,Crowded,Then why are you living at home?
11844,fail,Crowded,"Oh, Dad, you're so funny."
11845,fail,Crowded,I have a suggestion: how about I get two more glasses?
11846,fail,Crowded,"Ooh, I have an even better idea."
11847,fail,Crowded,"Ok, don't freak out, but I have some pot stashed in the playroom."
11848,fail,Crowded,- I'll go get it.
11849,fail,Crowded,- Don't bother.
11850,fail,Crowded,Why?
11851,fail,Crowded,- We smoked it.
11852,fail,Crowded,- We got rid of it.
11853,fail,That '80s Show,1 Whoa!
11854,fail,That '80s Show,"Hey, Sophia!"
11855,fail,That '80s Show,"Oh, wow, this is kind of awkward."
11856,fail,That '80s Show,"You're dancing with him, me dancing with her."
11857,fail,That '80s Show,"No, it isn't."
11858,fail,That '80s Show,We broke up.
11859,fail,That '80s Show,Oh.
11860,fail,That '80s Show,"Well, I wasn't really sure."
11861,fail,That '80s Show,"I mean, you know, when you said you wanted to see other people, I didn't know that meant not me."
11862,fail,That '80s Show,I should have been more specific.
11863,fail,That '80s Show,We're really not right for each other.
11864,fail,That '80s Show,Sorry.
11865,fail,That '80s Show,"So, you must be the new guy, huh?"
11866,fail,That '80s Show,What are you?
11867,fail,That '80s Show,A stockbroker?
11868,fail,That '80s Show,Drive a new Beamer?
11869,fail,That '80s Show,I'm a struggling musician who wrote 2 ballads about her last week.
11870,fail,That '80s Show,"Corey, he's not the new guy."
11871,fail,That '80s Show,I just met him in the bathroom.
11872,fail,That '80s Show,"Look, what we had was nice, but it's over."
11873,fail,That '80s Show,It's time to move on.
11874,fail,That '80s Show,Fine.
11875,fail,That '80s Show,"Hey, great."
11876,fail,That '80s Show,I am moving on!
11877,fail,That '80s Show,Good.
11878,fail,That '80s Show,So we're crystal clear on this?
11879,fail,That '80s Show,We've broken up.
11880,fail,That '80s Show,"Hey, I'm not gonna say it again, Sophia."
11881,fail,That '80s Show,It is over.
11882,fail,That '80s Show,Great!
11883,fail,That '80s Show,Take care!
11884,fail,That '80s Show,I want my tapes back!
11885,fail,That '80s Show,Would you quit it?
11886,fail,That '80s Show,I hate dancing.
11887,fail,That '80s Show,"Hey, is my nose bleeding?"
11888,fail,That '80s Show,Nah.
11889,fail,That '80s Show,You're good.
11890,fail,That '80s Show,Ok.
11891,fail,That '80s Show,I've got bad news.
11892,fail,That '80s Show,Sophia and I are finished.
11893,fail,That '80s Show,Aw.
11894,fail,That '80s Show,"Yeah, I've got some bad news myself."
11895,fail,That '80s Show,"Kids, your mother and I split up."
11896,fail,That '80s Show,That happened 2 years ago.
11897,fail,That '80s Show,I know.
11898,fail,That '80s Show,I just love saying it.
11899,fail,That '80s Show,What is that smell?
11900,fail,That '80s Show,"Now, that's the smell of my little entrepreneur."
11901,fail,That '80s Show,That's right.
11902,fail,That '80s Show,I'm making candles.
11903,fail,That '80s Show,They smell like death.
11904,fail,That '80s Show,Death?
11905,fail,That '80s Show,Or piÃÂÃ'a colada?
11906,fail,That '80s Show,Death.
11907,fail,That '80s Show,"Corey, Sophia wasn't right for you, what with her being a lesbian and all."
11908,fail,That '80s Show,"Katie, she's not a lesbian."
11909,fail,That '80s Show,She's bisexual.
11910,fail,That '80s Show,She's like a vegetarian who likes turkey every now and then.
11911,fail,That '80s Show,"That won't hold up in court, son."
11912,fail,That '80s Show,"Look, son, I know you feel lost."
11913,fail,That '80s Show,You've got this worthless degree in philosophy.
11914,fail,That '80s Show,That's your theory.
11915,fail,That '80s Show,Your sister's a big wheel in the candle game.
11916,fail,That '80s Show,Now you've gone and turned a perfectly good woman into a lady golfer.
11917,fail,That '80s Show,"But you need to get over it, get back in the game."
11918,fail,That '80s Show,Let me fix you up with someone.
11919,fail,That '80s Show,No.
11920,fail,That '80s Show,Oh!

12438,fail,Charlie's Angels,We were her family.
12439,fail,Charlie's Angels,She was our sister.
12440,fail,Charlie's Angels,How's Charlie?
12441,fail,Charlie's Angels,Devastated.

12457,fail,Charlie's Angels,Who were those people?
12458,fail,Charlie's Angels,It's just a precaution.
12459,fail,Charlie's Angels,They're sweeping the agency.
12460,fail,Charlie's Angels,I sent teams to your homes as well.
12461,fail,Charlie's Angels,You think we're being targeted?
12462,fail,Charlie's Angels,I can't confirm that you're not.
12463,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Gloria was family, and her murder is our most personal case."
12464,fail,Charlie's Angels,I need to know you're up for the fight.
12465,fail,Charlie's Angels,Bring it on.
12466,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Just remember, you're angels of justice, not angels of vengeance."

12475,fail,Charlie's Angels,Look at the ink.

12477,fail,Charlie's Angels,Means they were members of the same car boosting crew.
12478,fail,Charlie's Angels,I don't get it.
12479,fail,Charlie's Angels,Gloria waved good-bye to that life when she enlisted with Uncle Sam.
12480,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Bos, run her face against the Miami-Dade auto theft database."
12481,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Log in under detective Ray Goodson, badge 4-1-9-7-6."
12482,fail,Charlie's Angels,You're ex-fiance?
12483,fail,Charlie's Angels,Yes.
12484,fail,Charlie's Angels,Guess I can take impersonating a police officer off my bucket list.
12485,fail,Charlie's Angels,Password?

12496,fail,Charlie's Angels,Let's go ask her.
12497,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Whoa, whoa."
12498,fail,Charlie's Angels,Remember what Charlie said.
12499,fail,Charlie's Angels,What?
12500,fail,Charlie's Angels,These are just conversation starters.
12501,fail,Charlie's Angels,Guys.

12504,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Okay, calm down."
12505,fail,Charlie's Angels,We just wanna talk.
12506,fail,Charlie's Angels,Try knocking next time.
12507,fail,Charlie's Angels,Why did you kill Gloria?
12508,fail,Charlie's Angels,I didn't.
12509,fail,Charlie's Angels,Then why were you in stalker mode outside the agency last night?
12510,fail,Charlie's Angels,We caught you on tape fleeing the scene.
12511,fail,Charlie's Angels,That doesn't make me guilty.
12512,fail,Charlie's Angels,Innocent people don't usually run away.
12513,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'm not playing this game.
12514,fail,Charlie's Angels,Gloria was like a sister to me.
12515,fail,Charlie's Angels,We need to move.
12516,fail,Charlie's Angels,Now!
12517,fail,Charlie's Angels,"All right, we got 'em!"

12523,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Look easy, Abbs."
12524,fail,Charlie's Angels,Let's do this back at the office.
12525,fail,Charlie's Angels,"No, she starts filling in the blanks right now."
12526,fail,Charlie's Angels,I got a text from Gloria.
12527,fail,Charlie's Angels,She wanted me to meet her after work.
12528,fail,Charlie's Angels,Then why not come in instead of lurking around on the street?
12529,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'm shy.
12530,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Hey, did she say what she wanted?"
12531,fail,Charlie's Angels,Personal case she was working on.
12532,fail,Charlie's Angels,She wanted to show me something.
12533,fail,Charlie's Angels,Deal with them or come with us.
12534,fail,Charlie's Angels,It's your call.
12535,fail,Charlie's Angels,You girls decent?
12536,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Yeah, I just updated Charlie."
12537,fail,Charlie's Angels,I've got Gloria's phone records.
12538,fail,Charlie's Angels,She texted Eve at 12:35 a. m. Wow.
12539,fail,Charlie's Angels,She wasn't lying about your mad hacking skills.
12540,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Okay, uh, I'm not a big fan of the ""h"" word."
12541,fail,Charlie's Angels,It's like telling Picasso he's good at throwing paint onto a canvas.
12542,fail,Charlie's Angels,Wait.
12543,fail,Charlie's Angels,Gloria talked to you about us?
12544,fail,Charlie's Angels,Said you were the best crew she ever had.
12545,fail,Charlie's Angels,She never mentioned you once.
12546,fail,Charlie's Angels,That doesn't mean we weren't close.
12547,fail,Charlie's Angels,I met Gloria when I was 5.
12548,fail,Charlie's Angels,St. Theresa's orphanage in El Salvador.
12549,fail,Charlie's Angels,How did you end up in central America?
12550,fail,Charlie's Angels,My parents were aid workers.
12551,fail,Charlie's Angels,They were killed in the civil war down there.
12552,fail,Charlie's Angels,"When I got to St. T's, Gloria took me under her wing and protected me."
12553,fail,Charlie's Angels,Wow.
12554,fail,Charlie's Angels,From orphan to car thief to jailbird.
12555,fail,Charlie's Angels,You should have your own reality show.
12556,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'm not bitter about the cards I've been dealt.
12557,fail,Charlie's Angels,"If you wanna survive, you have to adapt."
12558,fail,Charlie's Angels,Is that what you're doing right now?
12559,fail,Charlie's Angels,I know you're upset because Gloria came to me instead of you.
12560,fail,Charlie's Angels,But the fact that your feelings are hurt isn't my problem.
12561,fail,Charlie's Angels,Ding ding!
12562,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Love a catfight, but, ladies, please, back to your corners."
12563,fail,Charlie's Angels,Mm.
12564,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Eve, according to her phone records, you two have been talking a lot recently."
12565,fail,Charlie's Angels,Yeah.
12566,fail,Charlie's Angels,"When I got paroled, Gloria was helping me get back on my feet."
12567,fail,Charlie's Angels,"I swept her hard drive, if she was working a case on her downtime, she left no trace."
12568,fail,Charlie's Angels,Do you have any idea what she wanted to show you?
12569,fail,Charlie's Angels,"No, but I think we should go check out her apartment."
12570,fail,Charlie's Angels,Let's do it.
12571,fail,Charlie's Angels,Since when can the cops spare extra uniforms to babysit a victim's apartment?
12572,fail,Charlie's Angels,Let's find a way in.
12573,fail,Charlie's Angels,Yeah.
12574,fail,Charlie's Angels,"That's Gloria's balcony, third floor."
12575,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Ladies, I got this."
12576,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hand me the Prada.
12577,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Abby put the ""cat"" in ""cat burglar."
12578,fail,Charlie's Angels,""" Now the doughnut patrol makes sense."
12579,fail,Charlie's Angels,Somebody made it a crime scene.
12580,fail,Charlie's Angels,But why trash her place?
12581,fail,Charlie's Angels,They even gutted her gator.
12582,fail,Charlie's Angels,I gave this to her last Christmas.
12583,fail,Charlie's Angels,This is pointless.
12584,fail,Charlie's Angels,I wouldn't say that.
12585,fail,Charlie's Angels,"You grow up in an orphanage, you learn how to hide things that are valuable."
12586,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Hey, guys."
12587,fail,Charlie's Angels,Since when did Gloria have a cat?
12588,fail,Charlie's Angels,She didn't.
12589,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Yeah, she's allergic."
12590,fail,Charlie's Angels,Then what's she doing with a kitty litter box?
12591,fail,Charlie's Angels,That's my girl.
12592,fail,Charlie's Angels,Nuns force you to be crafty.
12593,fail,Charlie's Angels,"It's a class ""a"" floor safe."
12594,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Blast-resistant, biometric lock."
12595,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Last time I cracked one of these, it was under two minutes but that was after two cosmos, and I was hanging upside-down."
12596,fail,Charlie's Angels,I know this box.
12597,fail,Charlie's Angels,This was her mom's.
12598,fail,Charlie's Angels,"At St. T's orphanage, she never let it go."
12599,fail,Charlie's Angels,It's a DNA analysis report.
12600,fail,Charlie's Angels,Came back yesterday.
12601,fail,Charlie's Angels,Gloria had two samples tested.
12602,fail,Charlie's Angels,A flake of blood from the box and Saliva from this shot glass.

12608,fail,Charlie's Angels,This is nestor rodrigo.
12609,fail,Charlie's Angels,Why would Gloria be tracking him?
12610,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Oh, my God."
12611,fail,Charlie's Angels,She found him.
12612,fail,Charlie's Angels,Found who?
12613,fail,Charlie's Angels,Pajaro.
12614,fail,Charlie's Angels,How do you know about him?
12615,fail,Charlie's Angels,It's a long story.
12616,fail,Charlie's Angels,But I had no idea she tracked him down.
12617,fail,Charlie's Angels,Time-out.
12618,fail,Charlie's Angels,Rodrigo's a multimillionaire.
12619,fail,Charlie's Angels,He throws more white parties than diddy.
12620,fail,Charlie's Angels,You sure he's Pajaro?
12621,fail,Charlie's Angels,I swear on my life.
12622,fail,Charlie's Angels,We need to call Bos.
12623,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Yeah, we need to loop in Charlie."
12624,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hey!
12625,fail,Charlie's Angels,Come on!
12626,fail,Charlie's Angels,Drop the gun!
12627,fail,Charlie's Angels,Give me your keys.
12628,fail,Charlie's Angels,Eve.
12629,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Eve, what are you doing?"
12630,fail,Charlie's Angels,Keeping a promise I made to Gloria a long time ago.
12631,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'm serious.
12632,fail,Charlie's Angels,What promise did you make?
12633,fail,Charlie's Angels,To kill Pajaro.
12634,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Eve, put the gun down."
12635,fail,Charlie's Angels,Let's just talk this through.
12636,fail,Charlie's Angels,There's nothing to talk about.
12637,fail,Charlie's Angels,That's why Gloria called me the other night.
12638,fail,Charlie's Angels,So what's your big plan?
12639,fail,Charlie's Angels,Roll up to club Cypher and blow Rodrigo away?
12640,fail,Charlie's Angels,He has to pay.
12641,fail,Charlie's Angels,"We loved Gloria, too."
12642,fail,Charlie's Angels,"We wanna get justice, but this isn't the way to do it."
12643,fail,Charlie's Angels,You have no idea what he's done.
12644,fail,Charlie's Angels,How about trafficking underage girls?
12645,fail,Charlie's Angels,He was behind a case we just broke.
12646,fail,Charlie's Angels,16-year-old runaway.
12647,fail,Charlie's Angels,"We managed to help her, but there were others we couldn't save."
12648,fail,Charlie's Angels,"We can rescue them, then take down Pajaro's entire operation, but not if you kill him."
12649,fail,Charlie's Angels,He can't hurt another girl.
12650,fail,Charlie's Angels,He won't.
12651,fail,Charlie's Angels,You have our word.
12652,fail,Charlie's Angels,Ahem.
12653,fail,Charlie's Angels,All right.
12654,fail,Charlie's Angels,I got confirmation.
12655,fail,Charlie's Angels,The prints on that shot glass are Nestor Rodrigo's.
12656,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Just so we're clear, Eve, you're accusing one of the biggest developers in South Florida of trafficking kids."
12657,fail,Charlie's Angels,You're sure this is the same guy?
12658,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Before Rodrigo was on magazine covers, he led a death squad in El Salvador."
12659,fail,Charlie's Angels,I know because I saw him with my own eyes.
12660,fail,Charlie's Angels,Gloria dared me to sneak into the chapel at the orphanage.
12661,fail,Charlie's Angels,"There was a wooden angel on the altar, and we were gonna carve our initials in the back of it."
12662,fail,Charlie's Angels,That's when the trucks came.
12663,fail,Charlie's Angels,Pajaro was there to steal the girls And he murdered the nuns and the boys.
12664,fail,Charlie's Angels,They wore masks and attacked without warning.
12665,fail,Charlie's Angels,Wait.
12666,fail,Charlie's Angels,"If Rodrigo wore a mask, how can you be sure it's him?"
12667,fail,Charlie's Angels,I have an angel to thank for that.
12668,fail,Charlie's Angels,We hid under the altar.
12669,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Gloria was clutching her butterfly box so tight, I thought she'd break it."
12670,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Pajaro came in to search the chapel, and that's when I saw his face, and so did Gloria."
12671,fail,Charlie's Angels,"I knew what he was gonna do with us, so I hit him with the angel."
12672,fail,Charlie's Angels,Uhh!
12673,fail,Charlie's Angels,And then we ran for our lives.
12674,fail,Charlie's Angels,The faces of the girls we left behind still haunt me.
12675,fail,Charlie's Angels,Is that why you and Gloria made your pact to kill Pajaro?
12676,fail,Charlie's Angels,I get it.
12677,fail,Charlie's Angels,You wanted him to pay.
12678,fail,Charlie's Angels,How are we gonna nail this guy?
12679,fail,Charlie's Angels,We aren't.
12680,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Abby, Bos, and I will take it from here."
12681,fail,Charlie's Angels,What?
12682,fail,Charlie's Angels,"This isn't about revenge, Eve."
12683,fail,Charlie's Angels,"If we're gonna shut down Rodrigo's operation, we need him alive."
12684,fail,Charlie's Angels,"About tonight, I'm sorry."
12685,fail,Charlie's Angels,Too late.
12686,fail,Charlie's Angels,You're benched.
12687,fail,Charlie's Angels,Rodrigo's been giving the cops the middle finger for years.
12688,fail,Charlie's Angels,We don't exactly play by the rules either.
12689,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Yeah, we're angels, not saints."
12690,fail,Charlie's Angels,I ran Nestor Rodrigo past my intelligence sources.
12691,fail,Charlie's Angels,Let me guess.
12692,fail,Charlie's Angels,He's squeaky-clean.
12693,fail,Charlie's Angels,Spotless.
12694,fail,Charlie's Angels,Sarah Daniels is the only one of Pajaro's victims that has ever been saved.
12695,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Abby, was she able to give you any insight?"
12696,fail,Charlie's Angels,She said she was chained to some other girls.
12697,fail,Charlie's Angels,Most of them were speaking Spanish.
12698,fail,Charlie's Angels,Here's an interesting fact.
12699,fail,Charlie's Angels,His foundation builds orphanages in central America.
12700,fail,Charlie's Angels,Rodrigo must be using it to funnel girls into the country for trafficking.
12701,fail,Charlie's Angels,I squeegeed his database.
12702,fail,Charlie's Angels,Somehow he's keeping all of his illegal activity off the grid.
12703,fail,Charlie's Angels,The man runs a criminal enterprise in the 21st century.
12704,fail,Charlie's Angels,The information has to be there somewhere.
12705,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Actually, it's in someone."
12706,fail,Charlie's Angels,Her name is Nadia Kozlova.
12707,fail,Charlie's Angels,She has a photographic memory.
12708,fail,Charlie's Angels,One of my buddies at MI told me about her.
12709,fail,Charlie's Angels,Thought she was an urban legend.
12710,fail,Charlie's Angels,She absconded with $14 million from the Russian mob.
12711,fail,Charlie's Angels,Rodrigo's bodyguards aren't only for his protection.
12712,fail,Charlie's Angels,They're for hers.
12713,fail,Charlie's Angels,"They go with her everywhere, except inside his star island compound."
12714,fail,Charlie's Angels,Did we say that you were benched or no?
12715,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Actually, I thought miss French could assist you."
12716,fail,Charlie's Angels,Gloria was the only family I had.
12717,fail,Charlie's Angels,I wanna help.
12718,fail,Charlie's Angels,It's fortunate for you that I believe in second chances.
12719,fail,Charlie's Angels,Don't let me down.
12720,fail,Charlie's Angels,I won't.
12721,fail,Charlie's Angels,Is this okay with you guys?
12722,fail,Charlie's Angels,It's Charlie's call.
12723,fail,Charlie's Angels,"According to his Twitter feed, Rodrigo is hosting a charity fund-raiser at his mansion tomorrow night."
12724,fail,Charlie's Angels,Theme is heaven and hell.
12725,fail,Charlie's Angels,Sounds like we'll blend right in.
12726,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Big party, lots of security distractions."
12727,fail,Charlie's Angels,We go undercover and grab Nadia.
12728,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Hate to buzzkill the plan, but don't you think police might consider that kidnapping?"
12729,fail,Charlie's Angels,The police need evidence.
12730,fail,Charlie's Angels,I only need certainty.
12731,fail,Charlie's Angels,Nadia is the best way to link Rodrigo to his crimes and take him down.
12732,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Watch your backs, angels."
12733,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Good-bye, Charlie."
12734,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Thanks, Charlie."
12735,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Good-bye, Charlie."
12736,fail,Charlie's Angels,Bye.
12737,fail,Charlie's Angels,Let me introduce you to my party people in the club la-la-la la la la la la la la la la la la la tonight we gon' be it on the floor la-la-la la la la la la la la la la la la la tonight we gon' be it on the floor There's Rodrigo.
12738,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Bos, are you set?"
12739,fail,Charlie's Angels,Truck's in position in the back by the bathrooms.
12740,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Once the spray hits Nadia's stomach, she'll start cramping within 30 seconds."
12741,fail,Charlie's Angels,"When she heads to the bathroom, that's when we'll grab her and get her to the catering truck."
12742,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Eve, stay on Rodrigo."
12743,fail,Charlie's Angels,Let us know if he moves.
12744,fail,Charlie's Angels,Got it.
12745,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Get on the floor straight to L. A. , New York Vegas to Africa Abbs?"
12746,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hmm?
12747,fail,Charlie's Angels,You wanna take the first shot at Nadia?
12748,fail,Charlie's Angels,She's right by the ice sculpture.
12749,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hmm.
12750,fail,Charlie's Angels,Can hardly tell the two apart.
12751,fail,Charlie's Angels,Looks just like her.
12752,fail,Charlie's Angels,Abby Sampson?
12753,fail,Charlie's Angels,Bridget and Priscella.
12754,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Uh, Dalton prep?"
12755,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Uh, yeah."
12756,fail,Charlie's Angels,The Wentworth sisters.
12757,fail,Charlie's Angels,Sure.
12758,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hi.
12759,fail,Charlie's Angels,"It's been, uh, it's been forever."

12764,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Recession's a bitch, you know."
12765,fail,Charlie's Angels,Oh.
12766,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Considering what your father did, I'd call it payback."
12767,fail,Charlie's Angels,Do you know how much money he screwed our Uncle out of?
12768,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Uh, no idea."
12769,fail,Charlie's Angels,"I, uh, I haven't spoken to my dad in Oh."
12770,fail,Charlie's Angels,That's for my Facebook page.
12771,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'm sure all your old Dalton friends would love to see what you've been up to.
12772,fail,Charlie's Angels,Yeah.
12773,fail,Charlie's Angels,Blini?
12774,fail,Charlie's Angels,Ooh!

12779,fail,Charlie's Angels,You are so welcome.
12780,fail,Charlie's Angels,Nice friends.
12781,fail,Charlie's Angels,Yeah.
12782,fail,Charlie's Angels,You all right?
12783,fail,Charlie's Angels,I will be in about 30 seconds.
12784,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Oh, my God."
12785,fail,Charlie's Angels,Instant ex-lax.
12786,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Well, at least we know the gut juice works."
12787,fail,Charlie's Angels,No wonder Gloria liked you.
12788,fail,Charlie's Angels,"You're up next, Kate."
12789,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hors d'oeuvre?
12790,fail,Charlie's Angels,"No, thank you."
12791,fail,Charlie's Angels,We missed our window.
12792,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Time for plan ""B."
12793,fail,Charlie's Angels,""" As in, uh, plan Bosley?"
12794,fail,Charlie's Angels,Whoa.
12795,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
12796,fail,Charlie's Angels,We never fully discussed plan Bosley.
12797,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Well, we know her deal with Rodrigo is strictly business."
12798,fail,Charlie's Angels,But Charlie's intel suggests she has a healthy appetite for the opposite sex.
12799,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'd say Bosley trumps Beluga any day of the week.
12800,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'll meet you at the catering truck.
12801,fail,Charlie's Angels,All right.
12802,fail,Charlie's Angels,That's the total number of guests.
12803,fail,Charlie's Angels,"58 servers, 29 busboys, 16 valets, 2 ice sculptures, and one very beautiful woman."
12804,fail,Charlie's Angels,What are you?
12805,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Doctor, lawyer, Internet billionaire?"
12806,fail,Charlie's Angels,Starving grad student.
12807,fail,Charlie's Angels,"My buddy's one of the caterers, so I tagged along for the free food and to watch the rich and famous in their natural habitat."
12808,fail,Charlie's Angels,And what do you think of the wildlife so far?
12809,fail,Charlie's Angels,Just got more exotic.
12810,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Guys, Rodrigo's on the move."
12811,fail,Charlie's Angels,He could be looking for Nadia.
12812,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Bos, time to put the party on wheels."
12813,fail,Charlie's Angels,Get Nadia to the catering truck.
12814,fail,Charlie's Angels,Why don't we find a place with a little more privacy?
12815,fail,Charlie's Angels,Yeah.
12816,fail,Charlie's Angels,The guest house is on the other end of the compound.
12817,fail,Charlie's Angels,My buddy's catering truck's right there.
12818,fail,Charlie's Angels,Down and dirty's not my style.
12819,fail,Charlie's Angels,Okay.
12820,fail,Charlie's Angels,Okay.
12821,fail,Charlie's Angels,Not down and dirty.
12822,fail,Charlie's Angels,We'll keep it nice and clean.
12823,fail,Charlie's Angels,You have five seconds to tell me who you really are.
12824,fail,Charlie's Angels,Fine.
12825,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'm a heartbreaker.
12826,fail,Charlie's Angels,Uhh!
12827,fail,Charlie's Angels,Ahh.
12828,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Nice job, Casanova."
12829,fail,Charlie's Angels,Took you long enough.
12830,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Guys, I lost rodrigo."
12831,fail,Charlie's Angels,Never mind.
12832,fail,Charlie's Angels,We got Nadia.
12833,fail,Charlie's Angels,Just get changed and get the hell out of there.
12834,fail,Charlie's Angels,Oh!
12835,fail,Charlie's Angels,(Chuckles) See?
12836,fail,Charlie's Angels,I knew the devil would get me eventually.
12837,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Eve, where are you?"
12838,fail,Charlie's Angels,Coming.
12839,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Eve, we have to move now."
12840,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'm delayed.
12841,fail,Charlie's Angels,Don't wait.
12842,fail,Charlie's Angels,Let's go.
12843,fail,Charlie's Angels,I kept that as a reminder of when I let two little girls get away.
12844,fail,Charlie's Angels,You killed my best friend.
12845,fail,Charlie's Angels,It was her own fault.
12846,fail,Charlie's Angels,She should've left the past alone.
12847,fail,Charlie's Angels,Nadia's missing.
12848,fail,Charlie's Angels,Your past is about to catch up with you Pajaro.
12849,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hmm.
12850,fail,Charlie's Angels,Ohh!
12851,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Eve, can you hear me?"
12852,fail,Charlie's Angels,What have we here?
12853,fail,Charlie's Angels,You're full of surprises.
12854,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Eve, are you there?"
12855,fail,Charlie's Angels,Ah!
12856,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Once I bring the ice princess out of sleep mode, she's all yours, detective."
12857,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hi.
12858,fail,Charlie's Angels,Easy.
12859,fail,Charlie's Angels,"The captain hasn't turned off the ""fasten seat belt"" sign."
12860,fail,Charlie's Angels,Where are you taking me?
12861,fail,Charlie's Angels,"You're 25,000 feet above the Atlantic en route to St. Petersburg."
12862,fail,Charlie's Angels,Ripping off a Russian crime boss wasn't exactly the smartest idea.
12863,fail,Charlie's Angels,Petrovski sent you?
12864,fail,Charlie's Angels,"These days, he hires pretty girls to do a man's job."
12865,fail,Charlie's Angels,"You hear that, Abbs?"
12866,fail,Charlie's Angels,She called us pretty.
12867,fail,Charlie's Angels,Such a sweetheart.
12868,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it."
12869,fail,Charlie's Angels,So turn the plane around.
12870,fail,Charlie's Angels,Rodrigo grabbed one of our team.
12871,fail,Charlie's Angels,Where would he take her?
12872,fail,Charlie's Angels,"As soon as we land in Miami, I'll tell you."
12873,fail,Charlie's Angels,You're lying.
12874,fail,Charlie's Angels,She'll be dead by then.
12875,fail,Charlie's Angels,It's my best offer.
12876,fail,Charlie's Angels,Here's some in-flight entertainment.
12877,fail,Charlie's Angels,It's a home movie of the last guy who crossed petrovski.
12878,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hope you're not squeamish.
12879,fail,Charlie's Angels,Now that guy is an artist with a nail gun.
12880,fail,Charlie's Angels,You think that scares me?
12881,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hmm?
12882,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Well, you should hear what he has in store for you."
12883,fail,Charlie's Angels,"If it makes you feel any better, he's all bent up about having to kill his little babushka."
12884,fail,Charlie's Angels,Isn't that what he used to call you?
12885,fail,Charlie's Angels,How did you know that?
12886,fail,Charlie's Angels,Enjoy your flight.
12887,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Oh, wait."
12888,fail,Charlie's Angels,Flamingo boat yard.
12889,fail,Charlie's Angels,He would have taken your friends there.
12890,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Okay, Bos, it's time to bail."
12891,fail,Charlie's Angels,Don't open that door!
12892,fail,Charlie's Angels,Are you insane?
12893,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Hey, relax."
12894,fail,Charlie's Angels,At least you're n in coach.
12895,fail,Charlie's Angels,Who took Nadia?
12896,fail,Charlie's Angels,Tell me where they took Nadia.
12897,fail,Charlie's Angels,Who took Nadia?
12898,fail,Charlie's Angels,!
12899,fail,Charlie's Angels,You had enough?
12900,fail,Charlie's Angels,Hmm?
12901,fail,Charlie's Angels,Just getting Warmed up.
12902,fail,Charlie's Angels,Just getting warmed up.
12903,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Oh, my God."
12904,fail,Charlie's Angels,Look.
12905,fail,Charlie's Angels,This is where Rodrigo must be storing the girls he traffics.
12906,fail,Charlie's Angels,Eve's running out of time.
12907,fail,Charlie's Angels,We gotta move now.
12908,fail,Charlie's Angels,New plan.
12909,fail,Charlie's Angels,You get the girls.
12910,fail,Charlie's Angels,I'll get Eve.
12911,fail,Charlie's Angels,Go.
12912,fail,Charlie's Angels,Uhh!
12913,fail,Charlie's Angels,Aah!
12914,fail,Charlie's Angels,Who took Nadia?
12915,fail,Charlie's Angels,!
12916,fail,Charlie's Angels,Tell me who took Nadia!
12917,fail,Charlie's Angels,Who took Nadia?
12918,fail,Charlie's Angels,Nadia's not as tough as this one.
12919,fail,Charlie's Angels,She'll break.
12920,fail,Charlie's Angels,Time to slash and burn.
12921,fail,Charlie's Angels,And kill her.
12922,fail,Charlie's Angels,Uhh!
12923,fail,Charlie's Angels,Bos!
12924,fail,Charlie's Angels,Uhh!
12925,fail,Charlie's Angels,Come on!
12926,fail,Charlie's Angels,You'll spend the rest of your life in a cage.
12927,fail,Charlie's Angels,"That's what you deserve, Pajaro."
12928,fail,Charlie's Angels,Aha.
12929,fail,Charlie's Angels,Thought I might find you here.
12930,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Gloria's Uncle used to own this garage, right?"
12931,fail,Charlie's Angels,Yeah.
12932,fail,Charlie's Angels,I rebuilt my first engine here when I was 13.
12933,fail,Charlie's Angels,But you're not here to talk about cars.
12934,fail,Charlie's Angels,Charlie told me he called you.
12935,fail,Charlie's Angels,Came by to see if you've considered his offer.
12936,fail,Charlie's Angels,Yeah.
12937,fail,Charlie's Angels,Um I'm just not sure why he'd want me.
12938,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Well, he keeps his criteria close to the vest."
12939,fail,Charlie's Angels,"My bet he's impressed with your abilities to adapt to situations, your above average driving skills, and the fact that your employment options are extremely limited."
12940,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Mm, yes, is that how he got you?"
12941,fail,Charlie's Angels,I was staring at a 20-year sentence for tax fraud.
12942,fail,Charlie's Angels,"Planted a virus in the I. R. S. Mainframe, skimmed a penny off everybody's tax return."
12943,fail,Charlie's Angels,My own personal stimulus package.
12944,fail,Charlie's Angels,"I've already done my time, and working for a voice in a box isn't really my style."

14684,success,Two and a Half Men,""" What does that mean, you know?"
14685,success,Two and a Half Men,Has a woman ever said that to you?
14686,success,Two and a Half Men,"Well, yeah."
14687,success,Two and a Half Men,But not a woman who doesn't like sex.
14688,success,Two and a Half Men,And Jake.

14724,success,Two and a Half Men,I sleep with beautiful women who don't ask about my feelings.
14725,success,Two and a Half Men,"I drive a Jag, I live at the beach, and sometimes in the middle of the day, for no reason at all, I like to make myself a big pitcher of margaritas and take a nap out on the sundeck."

14727,success,Two and a Half Men,"Good night, Charlie."

14734,success,Two and a Half Men,Will you take me swimming in the ocean?
14735,success,Two and a Half Men,Can we talk about it after my head stops exploding?
14736,success,Two and a Half Men,Why is your head exploding?
14737,success,Two and a Half Men,"Well, I drank a little too much wine last night."
14738,success,Two and a Half Men,"If it makes you feel bad, why do you drink it?"
14739,success,Two and a Half Men,"Nobody likes a wiseass, Jake."
14740,success,Two and a Half Men,You have to put $1 in the swear jar.
14741,success,Two and a Half Men,"You said ""ass."
14742,success,Two and a Half Men,""" Tell you what, here's $20."
14743,success,Two and a Half Men,That should cover me till lunch.
14744,success,Two and a Half Men,"Now, what I think you need to do is to make a list."
14745,success,Two and a Half Men,"On one side, put what you don't like about our marriage, and on the other side, what you do."
14746,success,Two and a Half Men,"Alan, sometimes when I think about coming home to you, I start crying in my car."
14747,success,Two and a Half Men,"Okay, that would probably go on the ""don't"" side."
14748,success,Two and a Half Men,Why would I lie?
14749,success,Two and a Half Men,The ocean is closed today.
14750,success,Two and a Half Men,"For God's sake, do you think you could put some pants on?"
14751,success,Two and a Half Men,"Look at me, Judy."

14756,success,Two and a Half Men,- It's not lunchtime.
14757,success,Two and a Half Men,That's his head exploding.
14758,success,Two and a Half Men,"Judith, I can change."
14759,success,Two and a Half Men,"Please, Alan."
14760,success,Two and a Half Men,"You are the most rigid, inflexible, obsessive, anal-retentive man I've ever met."
14761,success,Two and a Half Men,Rigid and inflexible?
14762,success,Two and a Half Men,Don't you think that's a little redundant?
14763,success,Two and a Half Men,My mom and dad are splitting up.
14764,success,Two and a Half Men,Yeah.
14765,success,Two and a Half Men,It looks that way.

14773,success,Two and a Half Men,Our little secret.
14774,success,Two and a Half Men,Why is she saying goodbye to him?
14775,success,Two and a Half Men,She's gonna be spending the weekend with her sister in Vegas.

14778,success,Two and a Half Men,"Well, with us."
14779,success,Two and a Half Men,I'm hungry.
14780,success,Two and a Half Men,Is this gonna be a problem?
14781,success,Two and a Half Men,I guess not.

14801,success,Two and a Half Men,Why would I be happy?
14802,success,Two and a Half Men,It's just milk.
14803,success,Two and a Half Men,Cute.
14804,success,Two and a Half Men,"Keep it up, you'll be on one of the cartons."

14812,success,Two and a Half Men,- You two are really good together.
14813,success,Two and a Half Men,- Thank you.
14814,success,Two and a Half Men,"So, does your wife sing, too?"

14848,success,Two and a Half Men,Take a break.
14849,success,Two and a Half Men,What took you so long?
14850,success,Two and a Half Men,We stopped for ice cream because I'm a babe magnet.
14851,success,Two and a Half Men,I got to take a squirt.
14852,success,Two and a Half Men,Why do you assume he learned that from me?
14853,success,Two and a Half Men,Because I learned it from you.

14862,success,Two and a Half Men,You've got somebody who comes in regularly to glue your cabinets?
14863,success,Two and a Half Men,You've met some of the whack jobs I've gone out with.
14864,success,Two and a Half Men,- It's not that big a stretch.
14865,success,Two and a Half Men,"- So, this is my fault?"
14866,success,Two and a Half Men,Who let her in?
14867,success,Two and a Half Men,"You're a deeply disturbed man, you know?"
14868,success,Two and a Half Men,Move it.
14869,success,Two and a Half Men,Come on.
14870,success,Two and a Half Men,I'm deeply disturbed?
14871,success,Two and a Half Men,Who came here in the middle of the night with his own sheets?
14872,success,Two and a Half Men,"At least, I care what I sleep on."
14873,success,Two and a Half Men,"Or should I say, who I sleep on."
14874,success,Two and a Half Men,"Hey, pal, of the two of us, I'll bet I'm the only one who's slept with a married woman recently."
14875,success,Two and a Half Men,And isn't that something to brag about?
14876,success,Two and a Half Men,"Hi, Mom."
14877,success,Two and a Half Men,Do you have any idea how hurtful it is to hear about your own son's divorce on the street?
14878,success,Two and a Half Men,What divorce?
14879,success,Two and a Half Men,What street?
14880,success,Two and a Half Men,How did you get in my house?
14881,success,Two and a Half Men,You stay out of this.
14882,success,Two and a Half Men,I'm here to help your brother through a very difficult time.
14883,success,Two and a Half Men,How could you do this to me?
14884,success,Two and a Half Men,Do what?
14885,success,Two and a Half Men,"Now when I want to see my grandson I am going to have to make an appointment with Judith, who, let's face it, was never very warm to me."
14886,success,Two and a Half Men,And what if there's another man there?
14887,success,Two and a Half Men,Shacking up with her?
14888,success,Two and a Half Men,Have we even stopped to consider that?
14889,success,Two and a Half Men,"I think he's considering it now, Mom."
14890,success,Two and a Half Men,"- Here's your iced tea, Grandma."

14894,success,Two and a Half Men,Here's what you're going to do.
14895,success,Two and a Half Men,You and Jake will come live with me.
14896,success,Two and a Half Men,"After all, I'm just rattling around in that big house all by myself."
14897,success,Two and a Half Men,"That's very considerate, but as soon as Judith and I work things out, I'm going to be back at my own house."
14898,success,Two and a Half Men,"Sweetheart, grow up."
14899,success,Two and a Half Men,Think about what I said.
14900,success,Two and a Half Men,"You're my son, and I'll always have room for you in my house and in my heart."
14901,success,Two and a Half Men,"I love you, too, Mom."

14903,success,Two and a Half Men,- Too little.

14906,success,Two and a Half Men,- It was fine.
14907,success,Two and a Half Men,"Alan, I really want to apologize for putting you through this."
14908,success,Two and a Half Men,I was wrong to blame you for my unhappiness.
14909,success,Two and a Half Men,"No, no need to apologize."
14910,success,Two and a Half Men,What's important is that we're here and we're working on our marriage.
14911,success,Two and a Half Men,"You look great, by the way."
14912,success,Two and a Half Men,Must be all the extra oxygen they pump into the casinos.
14913,success,Two and a Half Men,- Alan - And you were right.
14914,success,Two and a Half Men,I see now that the time apart did us both a lot of good.
14915,success,Two and a Half Men,I know I've grown.
14916,success,Two and a Half Men,"I'm not that suffocating guy you threw out of the house four and a half days ago, let me tell you that."
14917,success,Two and a Half Men,Jake's doing fine.
14918,success,Two and a Half Men,"You were concerned about him being around my brother, but Charlie's great with kids."
14919,success,Two and a Half Men,"All right, last card, down and dirty."

14930,success,Two and a Half Men,Yeah.
14931,success,Two and a Half Men,And I also know what a psych-out is.
14932,success,Two and a Half Men,I love this boy.
14933,success,Two and a Half Men,And I think we're gonna look back on this as a new beginning for our marriage.
14934,success,Two and a Half Men,A rebirth.
14935,success,Two and a Half Men,"A renaissance, if you will."
14936,success,Two and a Half Men,"Alan, I think I'm gay."
14937,success,Two and a Half Men,All right.
14938,success,Two and a Half Men,We'll make a list.
14939,success,Two and a Half Men,"On one side, we'll put gay stuff I'll see you and raise you $20."
14940,success,Two and a Half Men,"- I think he's got you, pal."
14941,success,Two and a Half Men,- He's bluffing.

16132,success,The Good Place,"- Every sandwich you ate, - - every time you bought a magazine, - every single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad."
16133,success,The Good Place,You know how some people pull into the breakdown lane when there's traffic?
16134,success,The Good Place,"And they think to themselves, ""Ah, who cares?"
16135,success,The Good Place,No one's watching.
16136,success,The Good Place,""" We were watching."

16605,success,The Good Place,Is there a pill I can take or something I could vape?

16617,success,The Good Place,Is there a moral imperative to help you?
16618,success,The Good Place,Do I have a greater obligation to my community?
16619,success,The Good Place,"Are you taking someone else's spot, someone who deserves to be here?"
16620,success,The Good Place,"Ooh, on that question, I honestly think I was just put here by mistake."
16621,success,The Good Place,"Because Michael called me Eleanor Shellstrop, so he knows I'm me."
16622,success,The Good Place,"He's just wrong about my overall ""quality"" level."
16623,success,The Good Place,"Please, help me, man."

16645,success,The Good Place,How did you know all that?
16646,success,The Good Place,Because you are constantly talking about yourself.
16647,success,The Good Place,You are the most self-obsessed person I have ever met.
16648,success,The Good Place,You should see Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.
16649,success,The Good Place,"Okay, this is my fear about you, Eleanor."
16650,success,The Good Place,You are too selfish to ever be a good person.
16651,success,The Good Place,"Well, I think you're wrong."

16662,success,The Good Place,- Let me see that.
16663,success,The Good Place,- There's no need.
16664,success,The Good Place,"Everyone here believes in my integrity 100%, right, guys?"
16665,success,The Good Place,Give it to me.
16666,success,The Good Place,"For the record, I did that out of principle, because it absolutely had your name on it."
16667,success,The Good Place,"If I check the other ones, I can figure it out by process of elimination."
16668,success,The Good Place,[indistinct chatter.

16681,success,The Good Place,If if I might?
16682,success,The Good Place,"I was just thinking, earlier today in all of the chaos, large swaths of this neighborhood were destroyed."
16683,success,The Good Place,"We thought perhaps some of us could, uh, volunteer to help clean up the debris."
16684,success,The Good Place,"You know, it's quite a fun way to band together as a community, isn't that right, Jianyu?"
16685,success,The Good Place,"Oh, uh, yeah, sorry."
16686,success,The Good Place,"For those of you who don't know, my soul mate, Jianyu here, is a Buddhist monk."
16687,success,The Good Place,"He took a vow of silence that he's still observing, even here, in the Good Place."
16688,success,The Good Place,It's truly inspiring.
16689,success,The Good Place,"Well, Tahani, it's not really your job to clean up, but I suppose there's no harm if you really want to."
16690,success,The Good Place,"Oh, well, hurrah."
16691,success,The Good Place,"We need about, uh, 12 volunteers."
16692,success,The Good Place,Oh!
16693,success,The Good Place,I can't believe all these people are passing on flying to pick up garbage all day.
16694,success,The Good Place,[chuckles.

16699,success,The Good Place,Dude.
16700,success,The Good Place,You want to prove you're not selfish?
16701,success,The Good Place,Here's the perfect test.
16702,success,The Good Place,"There's something fun that you want to do, and then there's something less fun that people are doing for the common good."

16704,success,The Good Place,Have fun.
16705,success,The Good Place,Whoo!

16712,success,The Good Place,"I'd say it's like 50 million simultaneous orgasms, but better."
16713,success,The Good Place,How's volunteer garbage pickup?
16714,success,The Good Place,- About the same.
16715,success,The Good Place,- Great!
16716,success,The Good Place,Whee!
16717,success,The Good Place,"You know, this really reminds me of my time in Vietnam, picking up mortar shells with my godmother, Diana."
16718,success,The Good Place,Doesn't really matter of what she's a princess of.
16719,success,The Good Place,It's not really important.
16720,success,The Good Place,Tahani!
16721,success,The Good Place,How goes the cleaning?
16722,success,The Good Place,"Oh, swimmingly, Michael."
16723,success,The Good Place,"And I have to say this neighborhood that you've built is truly a masterpiece, the likes of which I've never seen."
16724,success,The Good Place,And I've been to Johnny Depp's private bird sanctuary.
16725,success,The Good Place,"Well, thank you."
16726,success,The Good Place,That's very kind of you to say.
16727,success,The Good Place,[sniffs.
16728,success,The Good Place,] But it's also dead wrong.
16729,success,The Good Place,This neighborhood is a disaster.
16730,success,The Good Place,"See, I must have made a mistake somewhere."
16731,success,The Good Place,[sniffs.
16732,success,The Good Place,"] And it led to all this chaos, and now I'm just I'm just terrified that it's gonna happen again."
16733,success,The Good Place,"I'm trying to put a good face on well, this this face that I've constructed for myself."
16734,success,The Good Place,"But the truth is, I I'm just miserable."
16735,success,The Good Place,[sniffs.
16736,success,The Good Place,] I have to go.
16737,success,The Good Place,Thank you so much for your service.
16738,success,The Good Place,"Oh, no."
16739,success,The Good Place,Powerful people do not handle failure well.
16740,success,The Good Place,Michael could be heading for a total meltdown.
16741,success,The Good Place,"Soul mate, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
16742,success,The Good Place,Should we say it at the same time?
16743,success,The Good Place,All right.
16744,success,The Good Place,"One, two, three."
16745,success,The Good Place,We must help Michael.
16746,success,The Good Place,"Oh, you sly devil."
16747,success,The Good Place,"You're going to keep me on my toes, aren't you?"
16748,success,The Good Place,"All right, come on."
16749,success,The Good Place,Let's go.
16750,success,The Good Place,[giggling.

16764,success,The Good Place,And the answer is never.
16765,success,The Good Place,- You're never gonna stop.
16766,success,The Good Place,- [both giggling.
16767,success,The Good Place,"] Well, I have had a pretty full day of being unselfish."
16768,success,The Good Place,I've made some new friends.
16769,success,The Good Place,My area's almost garbage-free.
16770,success,The Good Place,"So you're gonna help me figure out how to stay, right?"
16771,success,The Good Place,"Well, that is a really tough question."
16772,success,The Good Place,"Most great philosophers would say helping you is pointless, that you can't try to be good, especially when your motivations are so obviously corrupt."
16773,success,The Good Place,"Yeah, but what do most great philosophers know?"
16774,success,The Good Place,"On the other hand, Aristotle thought that moral virtue is something that you could get better at."
16775,success,The Good Place,He he compared it to playing the flute.
16776,success,The Good Place,"The more you practice, the more you improve."
16777,success,The Good Place,Aristotle!
16778,success,The Good Place,"That's my boy, right there."
16779,success,The Good Place,He was the best.
16780,success,The Good Place,"I mean, most people agree he was the best one."
16781,success,The Good Place,"So it sounds to me like you are on board the ""help Eleanor"" train."
16782,success,The Good Place,"Well, I've narrowed it down to two possibilities: yes and no."
16783,success,The Good Place,"Well, no worries."
16784,success,The Good Place,Just hit me up when you're done weighing my life in your hands.
16785,success,The Good Place,I'll just keep doing what I do best: being super considerate and selfless.
16786,success,The Good Place,[exhales.
16787,success,The Good Place,"] Hey, guys."
16788,success,The Good Place,"Okay, Eleanor, reminder."
16789,success,The Good Place,"We switched to a rotating system for choosing a designated driver, and it's your turn."
16790,success,The Good Place,Got it.
16791,success,The Good Place,"Full disclosure, I forgot we were doing this new system."
16792,success,The Good Place,I got off work early.
16793,success,The Good Place,"I've been here for about an hour, and I'm already pretty drunk."
16794,success,The Good Place,Someone else will do it.
16795,success,The Good Place,Good call.
16796,success,The Good Place,Guess the only place I'll be driving is through the giant loophole in the system I accidentally discovered.

16805,success,The Good Place,It's remarkable.
16806,success,The Good Place,I got no-flavor.
16807,success,The Good Place,"- It's all I deserve, really."
16808,success,The Good Place,- No.
16809,success,The Good Place,"Look, I I appreciate you trying to cheer me up."
16810,success,The Good Place,"I really do, but you don't understand."
16811,success,The Good Place,This was the very first neighborhood that I got to design.
16812,success,The Good Place,"It was my chance to prove myself, and now I've blown it."
16813,success,The Good Place,"You know, sometimes a flaw can make something even more beautiful, like with Cindy Crawford and how short she is."
16814,success,The Good Place,"Oh, Tahani, if I made one tiny mistake in my design, if there's a single glitch in the system, if even one blade of grass is angled a a fraction of a degree off [dog whimpers."
16815,success,The Good Place,] The whole neighborhood is compromised.
16816,success,The Good Place,Whose dog is that?

16851,success,The Good Place,] - Everything everything seems fine.
16852,success,The Good Place,"Teacup, thank goodness you're okay."
16853,success,The Good Place,"Everyone, it is merely a construct of a dog."
16854,success,The Good Place,It feels no pain or joy or love.
16855,success,The Good Place,Teacup doesn't love me?
16856,success,The Good Place,Oh!
16857,success,The Good Place,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it definitely feels love."
16858,success,The Good Place,Do you actually want a dog that loves you a little bit more?

16967,success,The Good Place,You're doing this because you feel bad.
16968,success,The Good Place,And you're not even doing it to get me to help you anymore because I told you that's not gonna happen.

17521,success,Parks and Recreation,"I'm a nurse, and frankly, I don't really care for politics, but I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street."
17522,success,Parks and Recreation,Excellent.
17523,success,Parks and Recreation,That sounds like a good idea.
17524,success,Parks and Recreation,Tell us about that.
17525,success,Parks and Recreation,"No, it's a problem."
17526,success,Parks and Recreation,It almost killed my boyfriend.
17527,success,Parks and Recreation,Oh.
17528,success,Parks and Recreation,Yeah.
17529,success,Parks and Recreation,"There's a lot nearby my house, and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt, so there's just this giant pit, and it's been there for almost a year."
17530,success,Parks and Recreation,"Twelve months, yes."
17531,success,Parks and Recreation,Go on.
17532,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a musician, actually, I support him, but anyway, he fell in and broke both his legs."
17533,success,Parks and Recreation,"Ann, let me speak with you for a minute."
17534,success,Parks and Recreation,"So, your boyfriend fell down into this pit, right?"
17535,success,Parks and Recreation,Yes.
17536,success,Parks and Recreation,"And, this guy, is it pretty serious?"
17537,success,Parks and Recreation,Are you guys living together?
17538,success,Parks and Recreation,Yes.
17539,success,Parks and Recreation,"Wow, I'm sure this must be really tough for you."
17540,success,Parks and Recreation,"You know, just, this guy, sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken."
17541,success,Parks and Recreation,He's just weak.
17542,success,Parks and Recreation,You have to take care of him.
17543,success,Parks and Recreation,You probably feel like you need to move on.
17544,success,Parks and Recreation,"What does this Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body, just in Are you actually hitting on me right now?"
17545,success,Parks and Recreation,Oh.
17546,success,Parks and Recreation,Oh.
17547,success,Parks and Recreation,"God, no."
17548,success,Parks and Recreation,I'm not hitting on you.
17549,success,Parks and Recreation,I'm actually married.
17550,success,Parks and Recreation,"I'm just an open person, and I like connecting with people."
17551,success,Parks and Recreation,"I'm, you know, very comfortable around women, attractive women."
17552,success,Parks and Recreation,I've spent a lot of time with them.
17553,success,Parks and Recreation,And I just I don't know.
17554,success,Parks and Recreation,I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.
17555,success,Parks and Recreation,Maybe we can just exchange numbers.
17556,success,Parks and Recreation,"You know, maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this."
17557,success,Parks and Recreation,Look I'd love to do it.
17558,success,Parks and Recreation,"The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's government-owned, and you need to do something about it."
17559,success,Parks and Recreation,Okay.
17560,success,Parks and Recreation,I'll do something about it.
17561,success,Parks and Recreation,Really?
17562,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yes, we I will help you."
17563,success,Parks and Recreation,Is that a promise?
17564,success,Parks and Recreation,It's more than a promise.
17565,success,Parks and Recreation,It's a pinky promise.
17566,success,Parks and Recreation,"I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land."
17567,success,Parks and Recreation,Okay.
17568,success,Parks and Recreation,"LESLIE Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of."
17569,success,Parks and Recreation,"Recently, I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats."
17570,success,Parks and Recreation,"But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam."
17571,success,Parks and Recreation,"No, that sounds great."
17572,success,Parks and Recreation,"Problem is, anything over $25 I have to report, so maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll give them to me."
17573,success,Parks and Recreation,Morning.
17574,success,Parks and Recreation,"All right, Mr. Mayor."
17575,success,Parks and Recreation,That sounds good.
17576,success,Parks and Recreation,I'll see you on Saturday for the Ultimate Frisbee game.
17577,success,Parks and Recreation,Bye.
17578,success,Parks and Recreation,"Leslie, hello."
17579,success,Parks and Recreation,You were talking to the mayor?
17580,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yep, we were just rapping about some things."
17581,success,Parks and Recreation,Tom and I work really well together.
17582,success,Parks and Recreation,We're both outsiders.
17583,success,Parks and Recreation,"I'm a woman, he's a I think he's a Libyan."
17584,success,Parks and Recreation,"I am from Bennettsville, South Carolina."
17585,success,Parks and Recreation,I am what you might call a redneck.
17586,success,Parks and Recreation,"Okay, brainstorm."
17587,success,Parks and Recreation,How do we make this park happen?
17588,success,Parks and Recreation,Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.
17589,success,Parks and Recreation,"No, parks are not a priority."
17590,success,Parks and Recreation,I need more firepower.
17591,success,Parks and Recreation,I need bigger guns.
17592,success,Parks and Recreation,You know what I need to do?
17593,success,Parks and Recreation,Form a committee.
17594,success,Parks and Recreation,Right?
17595,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, that could work."
17596,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen."
17597,success,Parks and Recreation,Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.
17598,success,Parks and Recreation,That's really good.
17599,success,Parks and Recreation,Write that down.
17600,success,Parks and Recreation,Yep.
17601,success,Parks and Recreation,"From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down."
17602,success,Parks and Recreation,He's collecting them for my memoirs.
17603,success,Parks and Recreation,Here's Leslie's quote from Wednesday.
17604,success,Parks and Recreation,"Okay, read it back to me."
17605,success,Parks and Recreation,"Um ""Committees cover our democracy with blood."
17606,success,Parks and Recreation,""" Hmm."
17607,success,Parks and Recreation,Sounded better when I said it.
17608,success,Parks and Recreation,"It's still good, though."
17609,success,Parks and Recreation,"Okay, I have an idea."
17610,success,Parks and Recreation,What about bringing Mark on board?
17611,success,Parks and Recreation,Which Mark?
17612,success,Parks and Recreation,Which Mark?
17613,success,Parks and Recreation,Mark Brendanawicz.
17614,success,Parks and Recreation,Which Mark?
17615,success,Parks and Recreation,"Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that."
17616,success,Parks and Recreation,He's kind of like a fixer.
17617,success,Parks and Recreation,He fixes things.
17618,success,Parks and Recreation,"He's a smart, capable guy."
17619,success,Parks and Recreation,He just He knows where the bodies are buried.
17620,success,Parks and Recreation,"What's up, Brendanawicz?"
17621,success,Parks and Recreation,You crazy old Polish person.
17622,success,Parks and Recreation,"LESLIE City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you Then you can't take it."
17623,success,Parks and Recreation,You gotta leave the locker room.
17624,success,Parks and Recreation,Let's get down to brass tacks.
17625,success,Parks and Recreation,I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.
17626,success,Parks and Recreation,I just work right there.
17627,success,Parks and Recreation,"Well, thank you for clearing your schedule."
17628,success,Parks and Recreation,I didn't clear anything.
17629,success,Parks and Recreation,"You know this lot that I'm talking about, right?"
17630,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, Lot 48."
17631,success,Parks and Recreation,Condo developer.
17632,success,Parks and Recreation,"He dug a basement, and then he went bankrupt."
17633,success,Parks and Recreation,I checked it out like a month ago.
17634,success,Parks and Recreation,It's pretty gross.
17635,success,Parks and Recreation,What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park?
17636,success,Parks and Recreation,"A park, huh?"
17637,success,Parks and Recreation,Okay.
17638,success,Parks and Recreation,"Well, when I think about the logistics, the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through, I would say, is it likely?"
17639,success,Parks and Recreation,"No, it's not likely, you know."
17640,success,Parks and Recreation,"But, is it possible?"
17641,success,Parks and Recreation,No.
17642,success,Parks and Recreation,It's not possible.
17643,success,Parks and Recreation,I would give up on that one.
17644,success,Parks and Recreation,What?
17645,success,Parks and Recreation,Why?
17646,success,Parks and Recreation,Why?
17647,success,Parks and Recreation,I don't know.
17648,success,Parks and Recreation,There's like a million reasons why.
17649,success,Parks and Recreation,"Homeowners' associations, anti-government nuts, bureaucrats, miles of red tape Really?"
17650,success,Parks and Recreation,It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.
17651,success,Parks and Recreation,There's no way it can happen.
17652,success,Parks and Recreation,I can do this.
17653,success,Parks and Recreation,I just need a little help.
17654,success,Parks and Recreation,"Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake?"
17655,success,Parks and Recreation,Mark and I It's complicated.
17656,success,Parks and Recreation,"When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen."
17657,success,Parks and Recreation,We slept together.
17658,success,Parks and Recreation,Leslie?
17659,success,Parks and Recreation,No.
17660,success,Parks and Recreation,"Oh, my God."
17661,success,Parks and Recreation,You know what?
17662,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, we did, like, five years ago."
17663,success,Parks and Recreation,"I sort of No, but yeah."
17664,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, we did."
17665,success,Parks and Recreation,"Honey, can you straighten up your area a little bit?"
17666,success,Parks and Recreation,'Cause they're gonna be here soon.
17667,success,Parks and Recreation,Can Thanks.
17668,success,Parks and Recreation,"That parks lady is coming over, and we're gonna go take a look at the pit."
17669,success,Parks and Recreation,I think it's probably just a photo op for her.
17670,success,Parks and Recreation,"I mean, I don't think anybody in government actually cares about Honey, do you mind doing that somewhere else?"
17671,success,Parks and Recreation,I'm trying to watch TV.
17672,success,Parks and Recreation,I'm talking about the pit you fell in.
17673,success,Parks and Recreation,It's Ms. Perkins' house.
17674,success,Parks and Recreation,Doorbell!
17675,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, I heard it."
17676,success,Parks and Recreation,Doorbell!

17686,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, hey."
17687,success,Parks and Recreation,Of course I do.
17688,success,Parks and Recreation,"And this is our college intern, April."
17689,success,Parks and Recreation,She's going to be documenting our fact-finding mission.
17690,success,Parks and Recreation,"Hey, April."
17691,success,Parks and Recreation,Hey.
17692,success,Parks and Recreation,Is this fun for you?
17693,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, it's so much fun."
17694,success,Parks and Recreation,I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.
17695,success,Parks and Recreation,Sorry.
17696,success,Parks and Recreation,This must be our hero.
17697,success,Parks and Recreation,The man heard 'round the world.
17698,success,Parks and Recreation,Uh-huh.
17699,success,Parks and Recreation,"How you doing, son?"
17700,success,Parks and Recreation,Pretty good.
17701,success,Parks and Recreation,I'm Leslie Knope.
17702,success,Parks and Recreation,And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.
17703,success,Parks and Recreation,Could you pass me my itch stick?
17704,success,Parks and Recreation,Of course.
17705,success,Parks and Recreation,"So, Andy jumped over this fence."
17706,success,Parks and Recreation,"He was crossing through to get home, and then he fell right there."
17707,success,Parks and Recreation,"Oh, my God."
17708,success,Parks and Recreation,How did we let this happen?
17709,success,Parks and Recreation,"Dream with me for a second, Ann."
17710,success,Parks and Recreation,Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park?
17711,success,Parks and Recreation,"Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field."
17712,success,Parks and Recreation,We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.
17713,success,Parks and Recreation,It's really not that big of a pit.
17714,success,Parks and Recreation,We could do some of those things.
17715,success,Parks and Recreation,It's gonna take a little extra work.
17716,success,Parks and Recreation,But why not try?
17717,success,Parks and Recreation,I think that would be great.
17718,success,Parks and Recreation,"Me, too."
17719,success,Parks and Recreation,I'm going in.
17720,success,Parks and Recreation,Why?
17721,success,Parks and Recreation,Don't worry.
17722,success,Parks and Recreation,I have a hard hat on.
17723,success,Parks and Recreation,"I can see that, but Yeah."
17724,success,Parks and Recreation,"April, document this."
17725,success,Parks and Recreation,Document what?
17726,success,Parks and Recreation,"The key to any fact-finding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know?"
17727,success,Parks and Recreation,It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.
17728,success,Parks and Recreation,No!
17729,success,Parks and Recreation,"Leslie, are you okay?"
17730,success,Parks and Recreation,Leslie!
17731,success,Parks and Recreation,"Hold on, April's gonna get some photos for the website."

17733,success,Parks and Recreation,Don't move around as much.
17734,success,Parks and Recreation,"Okay, squeeze my fingers."
17735,success,Parks and Recreation,Good.
17736,success,Parks and Recreation,Does it hurt a lot?
17737,success,Parks and Recreation,No.
17738,success,Parks and Recreation,Mmm-mmm.
17739,success,Parks and Recreation,I'm fine.
17740,success,Parks and Recreation,"No, you're not."
17741,success,Parks and Recreation,Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.
17742,success,Parks and Recreation,But it It fell off.
17743,success,Parks and Recreation,After my head hit that rod.
17744,success,Parks and Recreation,Wow.
17745,success,Parks and Recreation,"I can't believe you fell in, too."
17746,success,Parks and Recreation,That's awesome.
17747,success,Parks and Recreation,"It's not awesome, Andy."
17748,success,Parks and Recreation,"Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle."
17749,success,Parks and Recreation,It's not broken.
17750,success,Parks and Recreation,It is.
17751,success,Parks and Recreation,Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things?
17752,success,Parks and Recreation,"Honestly, you're fine."
17753,success,Parks and Recreation,"Honestly, my clavicle's broken."
17754,success,Parks and Recreation,"Oh, hey, baby, if you're going to the kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick?"
17755,success,Parks and Recreation,Sure.
17756,success,Parks and Recreation,Ooh!
17757,success,Parks and Recreation,Are pancakes being made?
17758,success,Parks and Recreation,Thank you.
17759,success,Parks and Recreation,Sure.
17760,success,Parks and Recreation,"I don't know, she's a little doofy, but she's sweet."
17761,success,Parks and Recreation,"LESLIE Ron, please."
17762,success,Parks and Recreation,No.
17763,success,Parks and Recreation,No way.
17764,success,Parks and Recreation,"Come on, Ron."
17765,success,Parks and Recreation,I've been a loyal foot soldier.
17766,success,Parks and Recreation,Give me my shot.
17767,success,Parks and Recreation,Let me have Lot 48.
17768,success,Parks and Recreation,Is that a travel pillow around your neck?
17769,success,Parks and Recreation,"Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you."
17770,success,Parks and Recreation,When you've been down in the pit Have you been in the pit?
17771,success,Parks and Recreation,"No, I haven't gotten down there yet."
17772,success,Parks and Recreation,"Well, I have."
17773,success,Parks and Recreation,When you fell in.
17774,success,Parks and Recreation,When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact-finding mission.
17775,success,Parks and Recreation,"And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means."
17776,success,Parks and Recreation,"And let me tell you something, Ron."
17777,success,Parks and Recreation,What it means is I want this subcommittee.
17778,success,Parks and Recreation,I've been quite open about this around the office.
17779,success,Parks and Recreation,I don't want this Parks Department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.
17780,success,Parks and Recreation,I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.
17781,success,Parks and Recreation,My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.
17782,success,Parks and Recreation,Like Chuck E. Cheese.
17783,success,Parks and Recreation,They have an impeccable business model.
17784,success,Parks and Recreation,I would rather work for Chuck E. Cheese.
17785,success,Parks and Recreation,"Well, I will definitely think about it."
17786,success,Parks and Recreation,I like the sound of that definitely.
17787,success,Parks and Recreation,I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.
17788,success,Parks and Recreation,"Mr. Swanson, I presume."
17789,success,Parks and Recreation,Lot Park?
17790,success,Parks and Recreation,Giving the park to me?
17791,success,Parks and Recreation,Still mulling.
17792,success,Parks and Recreation,RON She's insatiable.
17793,success,Parks and Recreation,She's like a little dog with a chew toy.
17794,success,Parks and Recreation,"All right, you guys."
17795,success,Parks and Recreation,"All right, all right."
17796,success,Parks and Recreation,I'll ask him.
17797,success,Parks and Recreation,Everybody wants to know what your decision is.
17798,success,Parks and Recreation,Someone on the phone about the park.
17799,success,Parks and Recreation,"You know, I don't think I even want it."
17800,success,Parks and Recreation,Oh.
17801,success,Parks and Recreation,"Man, my clavicle's still really hurting me."
17802,success,Parks and Recreation,Oh!
17803,success,Parks and Recreation,This is a great shot.
17804,success,Parks and Recreation,I know.
17805,success,Parks and Recreation,That's awesome.
17806,success,Parks and Recreation,I think she's crying in that one.
17807,success,Parks and Recreation,Look at this one.
17808,success,Parks and Recreation,"Hey, kids."
17809,success,Parks and Recreation,That's another good one.
17810,success,Parks and Recreation,Hey.
17811,success,Parks and Recreation,"Hey, Brendanawicz."
17812,success,Parks and Recreation,You gotta come check this out.
17813,success,Parks and Recreation,"Leslie took us out to that pit in Lot 48, and she fell inside."
17814,success,Parks and Recreation,And we have some awesome photos.
17815,success,Parks and Recreation,One.
17816,success,Parks and Recreation,Is she okay?
17817,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, she's fine."
17818,success,Parks and Recreation,Oh!
17819,success,Parks and Recreation,This is a classic.
17820,success,Parks and Recreation,That's the best one.
17821,success,Parks and Recreation,The up-skirt photo.
17822,success,Parks and Recreation,Awesome.
17823,success,Parks and Recreation,"Hey, man."
17824,success,Parks and Recreation,Give me the photo back.
17825,success,Parks and Recreation,What's going on?
17826,success,Parks and Recreation,Don't worry.
17827,success,Parks and Recreation,I can print more.
17828,success,Parks and Recreation,Leslie is unique.
17829,success,Parks and Recreation,Government work can beat you down.
17830,success,Parks and Recreation,I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.
17831,success,Parks and Recreation,Leslie's kept hers for six years.
17832,success,Parks and Recreation,"I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules."
17833,success,Parks and Recreation,I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.
17834,success,Parks and Recreation,Why should I?
17835,success,Parks and Recreation,"You owe me one, remember?"
17836,success,Parks and Recreation,Do you want to cash in for this?
17837,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yeah, I do."
17838,success,Parks and Recreation,"LESLIE So this was built in And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks."
17839,success,Parks and Recreation,Wow!
17840,success,Parks and Recreation,"Oh, yeah."
17841,success,Parks and Recreation,This is our crown jewel.
17842,success,Parks and Recreation,It's one of our best murals.
17843,success,Parks and Recreation,It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.
17844,success,Parks and Recreation,"We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster."
17845,success,Parks and Recreation,That is horrifying.
17846,success,Parks and Recreation,"Yes, it is."
17847,success,Parks and Recreation,"So, what do you want to see?"
17848,success,Parks and Recreation,The DMV?
17849,success,Parks and Recreation,Animal control?
17850,success,Parks and Recreation,Or we could Leslie!
17851,success,Parks and Recreation,We did it.

19385,success,30 Rock,HBO-style content.
19386,success,30 Rock,"Well, it's not HBO."
19387,success,30 Rock,It's TV.

19410,success,30 Rock,"You know, I don't-- I don't think you'd like it."
19411,success,30 Rock,"'Cause we work a lot of hours, and it's live TV, which is risky."

19424,success,30 Rock,Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other.
19425,success,30 Rock,To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets.
19426,success,30 Rock,That's a metaphor.
19427,success,30 Rock,Sure.

20314,success,Scrubs,Now just suck out the fluid with the giant needle.
20315,success,Scrubs,Needle's too big.
20316,success,Scrubs,I'm gonna get a nurse.
20317,success,Scrubs,"Come on, man."
20318,success,Scrubs,Learn by doing.
20319,success,Scrubs,Why couldn't I do that?
20320,success,Scrubs,I hated him at that moment.
20321,success,Scrubs,"OK, maybe the needle was a little too big."
20322,success,Scrubs,- You think?
20323,success,Scrubs,- What's going on?
20324,success,Scrubs,Nothing.
20325,success,Scrubs,This is totally normal.
20326,success,Scrubs,So are you gonna move your stuff in?
20327,success,Scrubs,That's why I came by.
20328,success,Scrubs,I think it's better if we both branched out.
20329,success,Scrubs,Tell him that's stupid.
20330,success,Scrubs,Tell him you need him.
20331,success,Scrubs,I feel the same way.
20332,success,Scrubs,What's it like being a young hotshot doctor?
20333,success,Scrubs,"Did you ever go see a movie everyone told you was great and because of all the expectations, you were disappointed?"
20334,success,Scrubs,Movies nowadays have too many special effects.
20335,success,Scrubs,That was my point.
20336,success,Scrubs,My first code.
20337,success,Scrubs,"Someone's heart fails, they beep everyone."
20338,success,Scrubs,The first doctor in has to run the room decides if a patient lives or dies.
20339,success,Scrubs,"What, am I crazy?"
20340,success,Scrubs,You chicken.
20341,success,Scrubs,Don't worry.
20342,success,Scrubs,"Turk was there, ""learning by doing""."
20343,success,Scrubs,- Charged.
20344,success,Scrubs,- Clear.
20345,success,Scrubs,"The guy was just sleeping, attached to a faulty monitor."
20346,success,Scrubs,I thought we cared for each other.
20347,success,Scrubs,You just wanna sleep with me.
20348,success,Scrubs,I don't wanna sleep with you now.
20349,success,Scrubs,Do me right here.
20350,success,Scrubs,See?
20351,success,Scrubs,Right.
20352,success,Scrubs,Pass me a trach kit.
20353,success,Scrubs,Thanks.
20354,success,Scrubs,Our date is totally cancelled.
20355,success,Scrubs,I was sitting on the floor for two reasons.
20356,success,Scrubs,"One, I tried to lock Elliot in that supply closet and she kicked me."
20357,success,Scrubs,Hard.
20358,success,Scrubs,"And two, the on-call room was locked."
20359,success,Scrubs,"Come on, I got ten minutes to sleep."
20360,success,Scrubs,Wait.
20361,success,Scrubs,"Tell me if I'm going too fast, OK?"
20362,success,Scrubs,Lose the clothes.
20363,success,Scrubs,I heard Turk was gonna move in with Todd.
20364,success,Scrubs,I'm surprised that freak isn't in there with him.
20365,success,Scrubs,"Damn, this is hot."
20366,success,Scrubs,Nice.
20367,success,Scrubs,Your turn.
20368,success,Scrubs,"No, I gotta get back, but very nice."
20369,success,Scrubs,"Hey, Bambi."
20370,success,Scrubs,"I'll call you, OK?"
20371,success,Scrubs,"Give me a big ""ahh""."
20372,success,Scrubs,"A big-boy ""ahh""."
20373,success,Scrubs,Turk almost had sex in the on-call room.
20374,success,Scrubs,"You realise, of course, I have no idea who Turk is but good for him."
20375,success,Scrubs,"You see, Billy, it turns out that sex is life-affirming."
20376,success,Scrubs,What do you say?
20377,success,Scrubs,Got a urine sample for me?
20378,success,Scrubs,I just did five minutes ago.
20379,success,Scrubs,But here's the thing.
20380,success,Scrubs,"Take this, put it on the ground, close your eyes and go nuts."
20381,success,Scrubs,What do you say?
20382,success,Scrubs,- Cool!
20383,success,Scrubs,- Attaboy.
20384,success,Scrubs,Go get 'em.
20385,success,Scrubs,- Why are you here?
20386,success,Scrubs,- Seems like a good kid.
20387,success,Scrubs,You're worried about being on call tonight.
20388,success,Scrubs,Yeah.
20389,success,Scrubs,"Look, worst-case scenario you kill somebody and it's with you the rest of your life."
20390,success,Scrubs,But that is the absolute worst-case scenario.
20391,success,Scrubs,"Just have the nurses do the stuff you're too chicken to do which is everything, and if you have a really rough admission Call you?"
20392,success,Scrubs,No!
20393,success,Scrubs,Hide in the closet again.
20394,success,Scrubs,This is fun.
20395,success,Scrubs,- Nurse?
20396,success,Scrubs,- I'm a doctor.
20397,success,Scrubs,"The stethoscope, the beeper, a doctor, got it?"
20398,success,Scrubs,Relax.
20399,success,Scrubs,"I hate the ""darlings"", the ""sweethearts""."
20400,success,Scrubs,No need to tell me how hard it is being a woman here.
20401,success,Scrubs,You're helping by wearing a thong and hooking up in the on-call room.
20402,success,Scrubs,Word gets around.
20403,success,Scrubs,"You talk like that, do you even know my name?"
20404,success,Scrubs,"I spend every second of my life either here or taking care of my mom so, yeah, maybe I needed a little closeness."
20405,success,Scrubs,"You never had a quickie at the club, right?"
20406,success,Scrubs,Or snuck some skinny college boy up to your sorority room.
20407,success,Scrubs,And my thong?
20408,success,Scrubs,I think it makes my ass look good.
20409,success,Scrubs,"And some days, I need to feel good about something."
20410,success,Scrubs,And you judge me?
20411,success,Scrubs,"Well, guess what?"
20412,success,Scrubs,"Word does get around, Ms Out-For-Herself."
20413,success,Scrubs,"So you can dump on everyone here if you want, but you will not hurt me."
20414,success,Scrubs,"Her name's Carla, by the way."
20415,success,Scrubs,"Hey, champ."
20416,success,Scrubs,"First night on call starts soon, huh?"
20417,success,Scrubs,You must be excited.
20418,success,Scrubs,You betcha.
20419,success,Scrubs,About Mrs Pratt.
20420,success,Scrubs,I heard you wanted to put her on the hospital's transplant list.
20421,success,Scrubs,I'd recommend keeping her on dialysis a little longer.
20422,success,Scrubs,- Maybe we'll get lucky.
20423,success,Scrubs,"- No problem, sir."
20424,success,Scrubs,Great.
20425,success,Scrubs,Have a ball.
20426,success,Scrubs,On call.
20427,success,Scrubs,Little poem for ya.
20428,success,Scrubs,"Bambi, let's go."
20429,success,Scrubs,"I'll check on you every ten minutes, Mrs Marino, OK?"
20430,success,Scrubs,I need to see you in Mr Burski's room.
20431,success,Scrubs,Are you flirting with me?
20432,success,Scrubs,"You are, aren't you?"
20433,success,Scrubs,He crashed.
20434,success,Scrubs,The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.
20435,success,Scrubs,No way anyone could've caught it.
20436,success,Scrubs,- You have to pronounce him.
20437,success,Scrubs,- Why didn't anybody page me?
20438,success,Scrubs,Could you just pronounce him so I can go home?
20439,success,Scrubs,I'll never forget that moment.
20440,success,Scrubs,The way he looked exactly the same only completely different.
20441,success,Scrubs,The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.
20442,success,Scrubs,Time of death 0200.
20443,success,Scrubs,I just wanted to help people.
20444,success,Scrubs,The hardest part is how quickly you have to move on.
20445,success,Scrubs,"Don't worry, you're gonna be fine."
20446,success,Scrubs,I lied before.
20447,success,Scrubs,I'm scared every second.
20448,success,Scrubs,Really?
20449,success,Scrubs,It's a good thing they make surgical masks.
20450,success,Scrubs,If they didn't everyone would know my face was like this the whole time.
20451,success,Scrubs,I think it's OK to be scared.
20452,success,Scrubs,I need you to tell me that.
20453,success,Scrubs,He needs me?
20454,success,Scrubs,"I just came to check up on you, see how you're doing."
20455,success,Scrubs,Ask him to move in again.
20456,success,Scrubs,"Turk, the offer still stands I already took the keys out your bag."
20457,success,Scrubs,I love you.
20458,success,Scrubs,"And like that, I got a second wind."
20459,success,Scrubs,I'm watching you.
20460,success,Scrubs,- How you holding up?
20461,success,Scrubs,- There he is.
20462,success,Scrubs,My safety net.
20463,success,Scrubs,I saw that you're still pushing to put Mrs Pratt on the transplant list.
20464,success,Scrubs,"Bad news, though."
20465,success,Scrubs,She doesn't have the insurance to cover it.
20466,success,Scrubs,But she's a second away from total renal failure.
20467,success,Scrubs,OK Did you ask the Burski family for permission to do an autopsy?
20468,success,Scrubs,They're still with him.
20469,success,Scrubs,"It's a teaching hospital, you gotta ask."
20470,success,Scrubs,"Tell him you can't see Mr Burski again, he'll understand."
20471,success,Scrubs,"Sir, do you think I could skip just this one?"
20472,success,Scrubs,"Why, sure, sport."
20473,success,Scrubs,See?
20474,success,Scrubs,Every story needs a good guy.
20475,success,Scrubs,"In fact, why don't you just head on home?"
20476,success,Scrubs,You look kinda tired.
20477,success,Scrubs,I am pretty tired.
20478,success,Scrubs,"Dr Dorian, do you not realise that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me?"
20479,success,Scrubs,The only reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember your names.
20480,success,Scrubs,"If the patient has insurance, you treat them."
20481,success,Scrubs,"If they don't, you show them the door."
20482,success,Scrubs,"And if somebody dies, you get the autopsy."
20483,success,Scrubs,Get it by rounds tomorrow or I'll scratch your name off my chart.
20484,success,Scrubs,Clear?
20485,success,Scrubs,Answer me!
20486,success,Scrubs,Crystal clear.
20487,success,Scrubs,"Great, sport."
20488,success,Scrubs,If he's the jerk then who's the good guy?
20489,success,Scrubs,Car accident.
20490,success,Scrubs,Crashed on the way up.
20491,success,Scrubs,Relieve the pressure on his chest.
20492,success,Scrubs,"JD, do it."
20493,success,Scrubs,"God, no."
20494,success,Scrubs,Look at me.
20495,success,Scrubs,You can do this.
20496,success,Scrubs,- And I believed him.
20497,success,Scrubs,- Chest tube tray.
20498,success,Scrubs,"You know, kind of."
20499,success,Scrubs,"Come on, baby, let's go."
20500,success,Scrubs,You can do this.
20501,success,Scrubs,You have to do this.
20502,success,Scrubs,"JD, cut him or lose him."
20503,success,Scrubs,Give me the tube.
20504,success,Scrubs,I can't get through the pleura.
20505,success,Scrubs,"Don't be gentle, get it in there."
20506,success,Scrubs,"Connect it, please, Carla."
20507,success,Scrubs,- Normal rhythm.
20508,success,Scrubs,- No way!
20509,success,Scrubs,It's a piece of cake.
20510,success,Scrubs,It's your patient.
20511,success,Scrubs,You're leaving?
20512,success,Scrubs,"That's your patient, doctor."
20513,success,Scrubs,Good.
20514,success,Scrubs,- That's enough.
20515,success,Scrubs,- Sorry.
20516,success,Scrubs,It's a very big moment for me.
20517,success,Scrubs,I guess that's it for now.
20518,success,Scrubs,You finally off?
20519,success,Scrubs,Almost.
20520,success,Scrubs,I have one more annoying thing I gotta do.
20521,success,Scrubs,"If it's the Burski autopsy, I called the family and they said fine, and to thank you, and I'm sorry."
20522,success,Scrubs,"They didn't say that last part, I did."
20523,success,Scrubs,The worst part was knowing I could never forgive her.
20524,success,Scrubs,I forgive her.
20525,success,Scrubs,"You see, I can't survive on my own."
20526,success,Scrubs,I'm a dork.
20527,success,Scrubs,A dork.
20528,success,Scrubs,I'm a dork.
20529,success,Scrubs,"Even now, when I get to go home I'll know the hospital's still here, wide awake."
20530,success,Scrubs,Get out while you still can.
20531,success,Scrubs,But what the hell.
20532,success,Scrubs,The important thing is I got through my first three days without looking like a complete idiot.
20533,success,Scrubs,I'm the man.
20534,success,Community,Good morning.
20535,success,Community,How do we turn this off?
20536,success,Community,Can you help me turn this off?
20537,success,Community,Uh-oh.
20538,success,Community,Uh-oh.
20539,success,Community,Uh-oh.
20540,success,Community,How do we turn this off?
20541,success,Community,Can you help me with this?
20542,success,Community,"Oh, thank you."
20543,success,Community,Thank you so much.
20544,success,Community,I didn't mean to snap.
20545,success,Community,Good morning.
20546,success,Community,"Many of you are halfway through your first week here at Greendale, and as your dean I thought I would share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration."
20547,success,Community,What is community college?
20548,success,Community,"Well, you've heard all kinds of things."
20549,success,Community,"You've heard it's loser college for remedial teens, middle-aged divorcees, and old people keeping their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity."
20550,success,Community,That's what you've heard.
20551,success,Community,"However, I wish you luck."
20552,success,Community,"Okay, you know Uh-oh."
20553,success,Community,"Okay, there's more to this speech."
20554,success,Community,There's actually a middle card that is missing.
20555,success,Community,Can we all look around our immediate areas?
20556,success,Community,"Because I really wanted to I'm only half Arabic, actually."
20557,success,Community,My dad is Palestinian.
20558,success,Community,"He's a U. S. citizen, he's not a threat to national security or anything."
20559,success,Community,Lot of people want to know after they meet him because he has angry energy.
20560,success,Community,"Not like angry at America, just angry at my mom for leaving."
20561,success,Community,Although she did leave because he was angry.
20562,success,Community,And he was angry because she's American.
20563,success,Community,"My name's Abed, by the way."
20564,success,Community,"Abed, nice to know you and then meet you, in that order."
20565,success,Community,Now about that question that I had?
20566,success,Community,"Oh, uh Five after 11 when you asked."
20567,success,Community,Abed.
20568,success,Community,Yeah.
20569,success,Community,What's the deal with the hot girl from Spanish class?
20570,success,Community,I can't find a road in there.
20571,success,Community,"Well, I only talked to her once while she was borrowing a pencil."
20572,success,Community,"Her name is Britta, she's She has two older brothers."
20573,success,Community,One works with children who have a disorder I might wanna look up.
20574,success,Community,And she thinks she's gonna flunk tomorrow's test.
20575,success,Community,So she really needs to focus.
20576,success,Community,And she's sorry if that makes her seem cold.
20577,success,Community,Holy crap.
20578,success,Community,"Abed, I see your value now."
20579,success,Community,That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
20580,success,Community,Absolutely not.
20581,success,Community,"If these guys knew you like I did, they would have given you a small office."
20582,success,Community,"Jeff Winger, genius at law."
20583,success,Community,You gotta stop saying that.
20584,success,Community,I will never do that.
20585,success,Community,Sit down.
20586,success,Community,"I still cannot figure out how you got a jury to connect September the 11 th with my DUI, let alone why that helped."
20587,success,Community,"Well, 2002 was a simpler time."
20588,success,Community,"So, what is my lawyer doing here?"
20589,success,Community,I'm a student.
20590,success,Community,"Well, that cannot be an inspiring journey."
20591,success,Community,I am in a bit of a jam.
20592,success,Community,The state bar has suspended my license.
20593,success,Community,They found out my college degree was less than legitimate.
20594,success,Community,I thought you had a bachelor's from Columbia.
20595,success,Community,Now I have to get one from America.
20596,success,Community,Oof.
20597,success,Community,And it can't be an e-mail attachment.
20598,success,Community,"Well, you've picked a fine school."
20599,success,Community,Yes.
20600,success,Community,And I'm hoping that our friendship will yield certain advantages.
20601,success,Community,"You know, academic guidance."
20602,success,Community,Yes.
20603,success,Community,Moral support.
20604,success,Community,Every answer to every test for every one of the classes that I'm taking.
20605,success,Community,Here's my schedule.
20606,success,Community,"Now, Jeff, just by asking that you have insulted the integrity of this entire institution."
20607,success,Community,Oi.
20608,success,Community,Waster.
20609,success,Community,Not a bathroom.
20610,success,Community,Not a bathroom.
20611,success,Community,Okay.
20612,success,Community,"Duncan, you did seem less into integrity the day that I convinced that when you made that U-turn on the freeway and tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box that your only real crime was loving America."
20613,success,Community,"Well, I do love America."
20614,success,Community,I love it very much.
20615,success,Community,Mm?
20616,success,Community,L I love chalupas.
20617,success,Community,But I'll look into it.
20618,success,Community,Thank you.
20619,success,Community,"Duncan, you are a good man."
20620,success,Community,"Jeff, are you familiar with the adage ""Cheaters never prosper""?"
20621,success,Community,No.
20622,success,Community,"And if I wanted to learn something, I wouldn't have come to community college."
20623,success,Community,"Oh, hey, Spanish."
20624,success,Community,"Yeah, don't hit on me, okay?"
20625,success,Community,"Uh, I wouldn't dream of it."
20626,success,Community,I just wanted to let you know about my Spanish study group.
20627,success,Community,"Oh, whoa, whoa."
20628,success,Community,"The guy who's playing ""Bejeweled"" on his iPhone all class has a study group?"
20629,success,Community,Can I sign up twice?
20630,success,Community,I'm taking the class as an easy credit.
20631,success,Community,I'm actually a Spanish tutor.
20632,success,Community,Board certified.
20633,success,Community,Can you say that in Spanish now?
20634,success,Community,I really need help with Spanish.
20635,success,Community,"Yeah, I was willing to bet."
20636,success,Community,I'm Jeff.
20637,success,Community,Or jefe.
20638,success,Community,The group meets at the library at 4.
20639,success,Community,Britta.
20640,success,Community,Thanks.
20641,success,Community,You're gonna be there?
20642,success,Community,"That means, ""See you there."
20643,success,Community,""" Shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group, right?"
20644,success,Community,Huh?
20645,success,Community,"Oh, jeez, I'm sorry."
20646,success,Community,"I was raised on TV, and I was conditioned to believe that every black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor."
20647,success,Community,"Were you conditioned to pay for your damn tacos, Seinfield?"
20648,success,Community,Yes.
20649,success,Community,I'm so sorry.
20650,success,Community,"It's ""Seinfeld."
20651,success,Community,""" Hey, all right, come on in."
20652,success,Community,I've got the whole table.

20657,success,Community,"That's Man, the rest of the group is running late."
20658,success,Community,But you and I can get acquainted.
20659,success,Community,"You may have noticed this morning, not so good at the small talk."
20660,success,Community,"Yeah, I like big talk."
20661,success,Community,What's your deal?
20662,success,Community,That's not small talk?
20663,success,Community,What's your deal and is God dead?
20664,success,Community,"All right, you wanna know my deal?"
20665,success,Community,Mm.
20666,success,Community,I dropped out of high school because I thought for some reason it would impress Radiohead.
20667,success,Community,You'd be surprised what gets back to those guys.
20668,success,Community,I joined the Peace Corps.

20673,success,Community,Honesty.
20674,success,Community,Yeah.
20675,success,Community,"You tell me the truth, I will like you."
20676,success,Community,"You lie to me, I will never talk to you again."
20677,success,Community,That's my deal.
20678,success,Community,That's a good deal.
20679,success,Community,"So, what's your deal?"
20680,success,Community,"Uh I would have to go I would have to say, um, honesty."
20681,success,Community,"Because I would say anything to get what I want, and I want you to like me."
20682,success,Community,"So Well, that's a very honest answer."
20683,success,Community,"All right, for now, I like you fine."
20684,success,Community,Really?
20685,success,Community,Wow.
20686,success,Community,You're easy.
20687,success,Community,"Hell, yeah."

20695,success,Community,Why?
20696,success,Community,Britta invited me.
20697,success,Community,Is that cool?
20698,success,Community,"Oh, I can't think of a single logical reason why not."
20699,success,Community,Cool.
20700,success,Community,There you go.
20701,success,Community,"Oh, hey, here."
20702,success,Community,Put your contact info down right there.
20703,success,Community,That's right.
20704,success,Community,"Cool, cool, cool."
20705,success,Community,"Cool, cool, cool."
20706,success,Community,"Hey, this is kind of like Breakfast Club, huh?"
20707,success,Community,We are in a library.
20708,success,Community,Yeah.
20709,success,Community,I'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside that would make us cry if we talked about it.
20710,success,Community,Do you have something balled up inside you?
20711,success,Community,"Oh, I got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional."
20712,success,Community,"Hey, text message."
20713,success,Community,Let's give this bad boy a read.
20714,success,Community,It's probably just for you.
20715,success,Community,I've never gotten one of these.
20716,success,Community,"Uh, it's probably You just It's just for your eyes."
20717,success,Community,"""Say you have to pee."
20718,success,Community,I need to talk to you.
20719,success,Community,""" ""Say you have to pee."
20720,success,Community,""" That is weird."
20721,success,Community,"""Say you have to pee."
20722,success,Community,""" Yeah."
20723,success,Community,Do you have to pee?
20724,success,Community,No.
20725,success,Community,That's so weird.
20726,success,Community,"Well, I'm stumped."
20727,success,Community,That's very creepy.
20728,success,Community,That makes two of us.
20729,success,Community,What's that?
20730,success,Community,Does it say you have to pee?
20731,success,Community,"No, it's just someone with a misguided grasp of abbreviation."
20732,success,Community,"I just need five minutes, you guys."
20733,success,Community,So go ahead and study all the verbs in Spanish.
20734,success,Community,"Abed, what's your read on that guy?"
20735,success,Community,Yeah.
20736,success,Community,You look like Elizabeth Shue.
20737,success,Community,"Just act natural, pretend you're watching the athletic proceedings."
20738,success,Community,You couldn't stop me from watching them.
20739,success,Community,There's a guy trying out for track that is older than the game of poker.
20740,success,Community,He's kind of trucking.
20741,success,Community,Suppose I was to say to you it was possible to get those test answers.
20742,success,Community,I would say go for that.
20743,success,Community,And could have said so in a text.
20744,success,Community,I'm asking if you know the difference between right and wrong.
20745,success,Community,"I discovered at a very early age that if I talked long enough, I could make anything right or wrong."
20746,success,Community,"So either I'm God or truth is relative, and in either case, booyah."
20747,success,Community,Oh.
20748,success,Community,Interesting.
20749,success,Community,"It's just, the average person has a much harder time saying booyah to moral relativism."
20750,success,Community,"Duncan, you don't have to play shrink to protect your pride."
20751,success,Community,I accept you're chicken.
20752,success,Community,You trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist?
20753,success,Community,"No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless British twit."
20754,success,Community,I'm a professor.
20755,success,Community,You can't talk to me that way.
20756,success,Community,A 6-year-old girl could.
20757,success,Community,"Yes, because that would be adorable."
20758,success,Community,"No, because you're a 5-year-old girl, and there's a pecking order."
20759,success,Community,"Fine, I'll do it."
20760,success,Community,Thank you.
20761,success,Community,"Yeah, with pleasure."
20762,success,Community,Bye.
20763,success,Community,"Yes, good."
20764,success,Community,Why am I still shouting?
20765,success,Community,I'm drawing attention to myself.
20766,success,Community,You guys aren't going to believe this but the rest of the group is here.
20767,success,Community,Are you the board-certified tutor?
20768,success,Community,"That means you do my homework, right, Seacrest?"
20769,success,Community,I need to call my babysitter if we gonna be late.
20770,success,Community,What board certifies a tutor?
20771,success,Community,Where's Britta?
20772,success,Community,Not sure.
20773,success,Community,I invited people from Spanish class.
20774,success,Community,Is that cool?
20775,success,Community,It's the coolest.
20776,success,Community,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
20777,success,Community,"And bring my jacket, wallet and keys with me in case there's a fire."
20778,success,Community,Should we go with him?
20779,success,Community,Gonna leave my homework with Slumdog Millionaire.
20780,success,Community,That's borderline racist.
20781,success,Community,And busted.
20782,success,Community,Listen Now you know.
20783,success,Community,I'm a smoker.
20784,success,Community,"Yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe."
20785,success,Community,You ready to get started?
20786,success,Community,Looks like your group showed up.
20787,success,Community,Not mine.
20788,success,Community,I think Abed took out a page on Craigslist.
20789,success,Community,"And I was trained never to say this, but I think that group may be untutorable."
20790,success,Community,"Oh, really?"
20791,success,Community,Why don't you and I go study over Dinner?
20792,success,Community,Or drinks.
20793,success,Community,"I think, actually, we should prioritize here and study first and then go to dinner."
20794,success,Community,"And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early."
20795,success,Community,"Oh, they will be untutorable."
20796,success,Community,All right.
20797,success,Community,Look at this crew.
20798,success,Community,All ready to study all night.
20799,success,Community,I can stay at least till 10.
20800,success,Community,"But who studies with strangers, right?"
20801,success,Community,My name is Jeff.
20802,success,Community,"Jeff, it's a pleasure."
20803,success,Community,My name is Pierce Hawthorne.
20804,success,Community,"And, yes, that is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne Wipes the award-winning moist towelette."
20805,success,Community,I was just gonna ask.
20806,success,Community,I'm a Toastmaster.
20807,success,Community,I should do the introductions.
20808,success,Community,Definitely.
20809,success,Community,You know Brittles.
20810,success,Community,Britta.
20811,success,Community,Abed.
20812,success,Community,Abed the Arab.
20813,success,Community,Is that inappropriate?
20814,success,Community,Sure.
20815,success,Community,"Roy, Roy, the wonder boy Troy."
20816,success,Community,Little princess Elizabeth Annie.
20817,success,Community,"And, finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley."
20818,success,Community,Is that even close?
20819,success,Community,I'd like to know why I had to find out about this group on accident.
20820,success,Community,Way more like Breakfast Club now.
20821,success,Community,There's breakfast?
20822,success,Community,We should get started I've been a part of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension.
20823,success,Community,Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?
20824,success,Community,Did we not invite her?
20825,success,Community,"Sweetie, it's not behind your back Can we stop with the ""pumpkins"" and the ""sweeties""?"
20826,success,Community,Being younger does not make me inferior.
20827,success,Community,"If anything, your age indicates that you've made bad life decisions."
20828,success,Community,Shirley has a response to that.
20829,success,Community,"No, no, no."
20830,success,Community,I don't.
20831,success,Community,It looks like you do.
20832,success,Community,"Shirley, go ahead."
20833,success,Community,"Okay, okay."
20834,success,Community,I'm sure I've made some bad life decisions.
20835,success,Community,And maybe Annie's decisions will be better.
20836,success,Community,"I think she needs to decide whether she wants to be considered a child or an adult, because children get pity, but not respect, and adults, they get respect."
20837,success,Community,They also get their head grabbed and pushed through jukeboxes.
20838,success,Community,Okay.
20839,success,Community,"Why don't we try learning ""jukebox"" in Spanish?"
20840,success,Community,What are you doing?
20841,success,Community,Pierce.
20842,success,Community,Let's discuss this creepiness.
20843,success,Community,Pardon you?
20844,success,Community,What are you doing?
20845,success,Community,I'm certified.
20846,success,Community,Are you unaware that Shirley finds your advances inappropriate?
20847,success,Community,What advances?
20848,success,Community,You have been sexually harassing me since the very first day of class.
20849,success,Community,Sexually harassing?
20850,success,Community,What?
20851,success,Community,That makes no sense to me.
20852,success,Community,Why would I harass somebody who turns me on?
20853,success,Community,"Saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude."
20854,success,Community,Hey.
20855,success,Community,I am a prominent business leader and a highly sought-after dinner guest.
20856,success,Community,And I will not take courting advice from some teenage boy.
20857,success,Community,"Well, this teenage boy is a quarterback and a prom king."
20858,success,Community,"You're not prom king anymore, Troy."
20859,success,Community,This isn't Riverside High.
20860,success,Community,How'd you know I went there?
20861,success,Community,"Because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket, and, more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra."
20862,success,Community,Were you that girl got hooked on pills and dropped out?
20863,success,Community,You're little Annie Adderall.
20864,success,Community,And you're a stupid jock who lost scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.
20865,success,Community,Keg flip.
20866,success,Community,They're very hard to pull off.
20867,success,Community,Don't talk to me.
20868,success,Community,You don't know I'm a legend.
20869,success,Community,You know what I got for Christmas?
20870,success,Community,It was a banner year at the Bender family.
20871,success,Community,I got a carton of cigarettes.
20872,success,Community,The old man grabbed me.
20873,success,Community,"He said, ""Hey, smoke up, Johnny."
20874,success,Community,""" No, Dad, what about you?"
20875,success,Community,"Well, that actually was from The Breakfast Club."
20876,success,Community,Nobody puts Baby in the corner.
20877,success,Community,Dirty Dancing.
20878,success,Community,Hello?
20879,success,Community,It's Professor Duncan.
20880,success,Community,Come to the parking lot now.
20881,success,Community,What's wrong with your voice?
20882,success,Community,I'm disguising it.
20883,success,Community,I'll be right back.
20884,success,Community,"But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out."
20885,success,Community,No stone unturned.
20886,success,Community,Go.
20887,success,Community,Get in the car.
20888,success,Community,Act as if we've either just finished or are yet to begin driving.
20889,success,Community,Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester.
20890,success,Community,"I knew you could do it, buddy."
20891,success,Community,Thank you.
20892,success,Community,"Whoa, there, grabby grabby."
20893,success,Community,What do I get?
20894,success,Community,The satisfaction of being even.
20895,success,Community,"Even, fairness, right, wrong."
20896,success,Community,There is no God.
20897,success,Community,"Booyah, booyah."
20898,success,Community,What do you want from me?
20899,success,Community,Your Lexus.
20900,success,Community,My car for a semester's worth of answers?
20901,success,Community,"Will it be just a semester, though, Jeff?"
20902,success,Community,Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years?
20903,success,Community,I want payment in advance.
20904,success,Community,I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers.
20905,success,Community,"You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies."
20906,success,Community,Have a nice disbarment hearing.
20907,success,Community,What am I supposed to drive?
20908,success,Community,Take this car.
20909,success,Community,It's good for the earth.
20910,success,Community,So is wiping your butt with a leaf but it's not how a man gets around.
20911,success,Community,Golf cart.
20912,success,Community,It is a disaster in there.
20913,success,Community,Yeah.
20914,success,Community,Untutorable.
20915,success,Community,Do you like Thai food?
20916,success,Community,I love Thai food.
20917,success,Community,Wait.
20918,success,Community,So this is a game to you?
20919,success,Community,You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants?
20920,success,Community,Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is?
20921,success,Community,"Okay, okay, okay."
20922,success,Community,I'm sorry.
20923,success,Community,It was an accident.
20924,success,Community,I did a little bit of lying to get close to you.
20925,success,Community,But how was I supposed to know that you were smart and cool.
20926,success,Community,You look like Elizabeth Shue.
20927,success,Community,You're unbelievable.
20928,success,Community,What do you want me to do?
20929,success,Community,Maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.
20930,success,Community,"Okay, if I do that, then dinner, right?"
20931,success,Community,"Yeah, fine, whatever."
20932,success,Community,As if there's a dinner on earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douche bag.
20933,success,Community,"Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car."
20934,success,Community,"All right, everybody."
20935,success,Community,I wanna say something.
20936,success,Community,Sit down.
20937,success,Community,"Well, you don't have to yell."
20938,success,Community,I don't appreciate your tone.
20939,success,Community,What makes humans different from other animals?
20940,success,Community,Feet.
20941,success,Community,"No, no."
20942,success,Community,"Come on, bears have feet."
20943,success,Community,"We're the only species on earth that observes ""Shark Week."
20944,success,Community,""" Sharks don't even observe ""Shark Week,"" but we do."
20945,success,Community,"For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve and go like this."
20946,success,Community,Oh.
20947,success,Community,And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside.
20948,success,Community,Because people can connect with anything.
20949,success,Community,"We can sympathize with a pencil, we can forgive a shark, and we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for screenwriting."
20950,success,Community,Big mistake.
20951,success,Community,People can find the good in just about anything but themselves.
20952,success,Community,Look at me.
20953,success,Community,It's clear to all of you that I am awesome.
20954,success,Community,But I could never admit that.
20955,success,Community,That would make me an ass.
20956,success,Community,But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome.
20957,success,Community,She's driven.
20958,success,Community,We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts.
20959,success,Community,"And Pierce, we need guys like Pierce."
20960,success,Community,This guy has wisdom to offer.
20961,success,Community,The Dalai Lama and l We should listen to him some time.
20962,success,Community,We wouldn't regret it.
20963,success,Community,"And Shirley, Shirley has earned our respect."
20964,success,Community,"Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman."
20965,success,Community,"Don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was too specific to be improvised."
20966,success,Community,And Troy.
20967,success,Community,Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that?
20968,success,Community,Maybe he is.
20969,success,Community,You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen?
20970,success,Community,"No, they're trying to impress their high school's prom king."
20971,success,Community,And Abed.
20972,success,Community,Abed's a shaman.
20973,success,Community,"You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup."
20974,success,Community,"Because you know what, soup is better."
20975,success,Community,Abed is better.
20976,success,Community,You are all better than you think you are.
20977,success,Community,You are designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.
20978,success,Community,Soup?
20979,success,Community,I want you to look to the person to your left.
20980,success,Community,Sorry.
20981,success,Community,Look at the person sitting next to you.
20982,success,Community,Look at her.
20983,success,Community,Okay.
20984,success,Community,This?
20985,success,Community,Yeah.
20986,success,Community,"I want you to extend to that person the same compassion you extend to sharks, pencils and Ben Affleck."
20987,success,Community,"I want you to say to that person, ""I forgive you."
20988,success,Community,""" I forgive you."
20989,success,Community,I forgive you.
20990,success,Community,I forgive you.
20991,success,Community,You little twerp.
20992,success,Community,"Pierce, I'd like you to say, ""I forgive you."
20993,success,Community,""" He didn't say it?"
20994,success,Community,I forgive you.
20995,success,Community,You've just stopped being a study group.
20996,success,Community,You have become something unstoppable.
20997,success,Community,I hereby pronounce you a community.
20998,success,Community,"Oh, that's nice."
20999,success,Community,I like that.
21000,success,Community,This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore.
21001,success,Community,It's Stripes or Meatballs.
21002,success,Community,Anything with Bill Murray.
21003,success,Community,I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special.
21004,success,Community,"And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta."
21005,success,Community,Britta?
21006,success,Community,I lied.
21007,success,Community,Thanks for calming everyone down.
21008,success,Community,"But since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me."
21009,success,Community,I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.
21010,success,Community,Everybody ready?
21011,success,Community,Fine.
21012,success,Community,And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test.
21013,success,Community,And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I wasted more than they wasted mine.
21014,success,Community,"Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this group?"
21015,success,Community,I don't have a study group.
21016,success,Community,I made it up.
21017,success,Community,What about the speech?
21018,success,Community,Made it up.
21019,success,Community,That's what I do.
21020,success,Community,I make things up.
21021,success,Community,And I got paid a lot of money to do it.
21022,success,Community,"Before I came to this school-shaped toilet, I was a lawyer."
21023,success,Community,"Oh, man, this ruins everything."
21024,success,Community,I thought you were like Bill Murray in his films.
21025,success,Community,But you're more like Michael Douglas in his films.
21026,success,Community,Yeah?
21027,success,Community,"Well, you have Asperger's."
21028,success,Community,What does that mean?
21029,success,Community,"Ha, ha."
21030,success,Community,Ass burger.
21031,success,Community,It's a serious disorder.
21032,success,Community,It really is.
21033,success,Community,"If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?"
21034,success,Community,"Heh, heh."
21035,success,Community,Yeah.
21036,success,Community,"Heh, heh."
21037,success,Community,Ass burger.
21038,success,Community,Burger for your ass.
21039,success,Community,"Jeffrey, before you say anything, you might want to think about the gift you've been given."
21040,success,Community,An excuse to punch a hippy?
21041,success,Community,No.
21042,success,Community,"No, not that."
21043,success,Community,"An important lesson, my friend."

21120,success,Black-ish,"Sometimes I worry that, in an effort to make it, black folks have dropped a little bit of their culture and the rest of the world has picked it up."
21121,success,Black-ish,"They even renamed it ""Urban""."
21122,success,Black-ish,"And in the ""Urban"" world, Justin Timberlake and Robin Thicke are R&B Gods, Kim Kardashian's the symbol for big butts, and asian guys are just unholdable on the dance floor."

21156,success,Black-ish,This job is about more than just money to me.
21157,success,Black-ish,It's about breaking down barriers.
21158,success,Black-ish,Yeah.
21159,success,Black-ish,Breaking down barriers equally important to money.
21160,success,Black-ish,"But just so that I'm clear, there is a salary increase, right?"

21188,success,Black-ish,"Man, isn't that a woman's sport?"
21189,success,Black-ish,Nope.
21190,success,Black-ish,"Um, a lot of people think that, though."

21196,success,Black-ish,Hey.
21197,success,Black-ish,"It's not about the accuracy, son, all right?"
21198,success,Black-ish,The family is known for our form.

21200,success,Black-ish,Look at that elbow.
21201,success,Black-ish,Look at that.

21213,success,Black-ish,"""Andy""?"
21214,success,Black-ish,"That's not even close to ""Andre""."
21215,success,Black-ish,I think it says I'm edgy but approachable.
21216,success,Black-ish,"I think it says, ""I hate my father and I play field hockey""."
21217,success,Black-ish,"Well, Zach thinks it's cool, and it's also a derivative of ""Andre""."
21218,success,Black-ish,"We discussed it, and I think I like that There were so few of us at Stevens & Lido that being black made you feel like you were part of a little family."
21219,success,Black-ish,"So when one of us made it, it was kind of like we all did."
21220,success,Black-ish,Who do you think you are?
21221,success,Black-ish,"And right now, I was that one."
21222,success,Black-ish,"I'm not saying I was the Jackie Robinson of Stevens & Lido advertising or anything, but, I mean, if other people were saying it, they wouldn't be wrong."

21227,success,Black-ish,"This is my assistant, Kris."
21228,success,Black-ish,Notice how I do the shake with him.
21229,success,Black-ish,That's because I consider him an honorary brother.

21231,success,Black-ish,- Yeah.

21251,success,Black-ish,"You know, I'm hearing ""historic,"" ""game-changing"" being tossed around."
21252,success,Black-ish,Could just be office gossip.
21253,success,Black-ish,Ha ha!
21254,success,Black-ish,"If I could have your attention At Stevens & Lido, there was a clear separation between lower management and upper management."
21255,success,Black-ish,And that always made me feel like it was us - versus them.
21256,success,Black-ish,- get ready to work.
21257,success,Black-ish,Even our snacks were divided.
21258,success,Black-ish,"We get cheetos and grape soda, while they always get what looks like a medieval feast!"
21259,success,Black-ish,"Let's eat, let's eat!"

21316,success,Black-ish,- It's fried chicken.
21317,success,Black-ish,- Really?
21318,success,Black-ish,- It's baked fried chicken.
21319,success,Black-ish,"Oh, so fried fried chicken is too black for you."
21320,success,Black-ish,- Pops!
21321,success,Black-ish,"Pops, seriously?"

21327,success,Black-ish,"You know, I I do feel like a puppet."
21328,success,Black-ish,As you should.
21329,success,Black-ish,"I said I wanted to be the first black SVP for Stevens & Lido, when, actually, I wanted to be the first SVP who happened to be black."
21330,success,Black-ish,What's the difference?
21331,success,Black-ish,Obama's the first black president.
21332,success,Black-ish,"I mean, does that make him any less president?"
21333,success,Black-ish,No.
21334,success,Black-ish,"No, because he's the first black president of the United States, not the first black president of the Urban United States."
21335,success,Black-ish,Obama's the first black president?
21336,success,Black-ish,What you're doing a bang-up job over here.
21337,success,Black-ish,"No, no, no."
21338,success,Black-ish,Hold on a second.
21339,success,Black-ish,Let's explore this.
21340,success,Black-ish,"Jack, did you really not know that Obama was the first black president?"
21341,success,Black-ish,He's the only president I've ever known.
21342,success,Black-ish,"- ""Only""."
21343,success,Black-ish,Did you hear that?
21344,success,Black-ish,"""Only""."
21345,success,Black-ish,- He gets a pass.
21346,success,Black-ish,So that explains his complete lack of Presidential Trivia.
21347,success,Black-ish,Hey.
21348,success,Black-ish,You two.
21349,success,Black-ish,"You knew that Obama was the first black president, right?"
21350,success,Black-ish,- I g guess.
21351,success,Black-ish,- Okay.
21352,success,Black-ish,"""Okay""?"
21353,success,Black-ish,Mm-hmm.
21354,success,Black-ish,See what I'm talking about?
21355,success,Black-ish,Baked chicken.
21356,success,Black-ish,- What you doing?
21357,success,Black-ish,- Looking at pictures of my Urban family.
21358,success,Black-ish,"Oh, my God."
21359,success,Black-ish,You got to stop with the whole pity-party thing.
21360,success,Black-ish,You don't think I go through this kind of thing all the time being a female doctor?
21361,success,Black-ish,It's not that big of a deal.
21362,success,Black-ish,You got to keep it real.
21363,success,Black-ish,"- ""Keep it real""."
21364,success,Black-ish,O okay.
21365,success,Black-ish,- That's what I said.
21366,success,Black-ish,"All all this coming from, uh, a biracial or mixed or omni-colored-complexion, whatever-it-is-they're- calling-it-today woman - who technically isn't even really black?"
21367,success,Black-ish,"- Okay, well, if I'm not really black, then could somebody please tell my hair and my ass?"
21368,success,Black-ish,"- Babe, you don't get it."
21369,success,Black-ish,- No.
21370,success,Black-ish,- This is how it starts.
21371,success,Black-ish,- What?
21372,success,Black-ish,"Babe, Junior wants to play field hockey."
21373,success,Black-ish,- I know.
21374,success,Black-ish,What's wrong with that?
21375,success,Black-ish,"- I today, it's field hockey."
21376,success,Black-ish,"Tomorrow, he's running from the police in a white bronco."
21377,success,Black-ish,"Oh, my God are you suggesting that our son is gonna grow up and murder his wife?"
21378,success,Black-ish,- Aha!
21379,success,Black-ish,You think O. J. did it!
21380,success,Black-ish,"- Oh, come on."
21381,success,Black-ish,We can't have a keeping-it-real conversation with that attitude.
21382,success,Black-ish,"No, no, no."
21383,success,Black-ish,"Stop, babe."

21391,success,Black-ish,"If you pass up this promotion, we're 0 for 3."
21392,success,Black-ish,"Maybe you're right, babe."
21393,success,Black-ish,- Ooh.

21404,success,Black-ish,- No.
21405,success,Black-ish,no!
21406,success,Black-ish,There he is my main man.

21411,success,Black-ish,Keep it keep it real.
21412,success,Black-ish,Keep it real?
21413,success,Black-ish,Yeah.
21414,success,Black-ish,"Be honest, be smart, be you."
21415,success,Black-ish,"What, uh, what did you think I meant?"
21416,success,Black-ish,I thought you meant that.
21417,success,Black-ish,Okay.
21418,success,Black-ish,"""Keep it real""."
21419,success,Black-ish,"What's up, Drigitty-Dre?"
21420,success,Black-ish,- * Rewind * - My name's not - Drigitty-Dre-Dre what?
21421,success,Black-ish,Kick it.

21424,success,Black-ish,"- Hey, babe."
21425,success,Black-ish,"- Mommy, mommy."
21426,success,Black-ish,- Mom.
21427,success,Black-ish,- Yeah?
21428,success,Black-ish,Liza Jackson asked if we could have a playdate.
21429,success,Black-ish,"She's weird, so feel free to say ""no""."
21430,success,Black-ish,Liza Jackson?
21431,success,Black-ish,Which one is she?
21432,success,Black-ish,"You know, wears the Nemo shoes every single day?"
21433,success,Black-ish,And the polka-dot backpack.

21435,success,Black-ish,Wait a second.
21436,success,Black-ish,Are you guys talking about the only other little black girl in your class?
21437,success,Black-ish,- Yeah.
21438,success,Black-ish,- Yeah.
21439,success,Black-ish,- Why didn't you just say that?
21440,success,Black-ish,- I don't know.
21441,success,Black-ish,"Guess when I hear ""Liza Jackson,"" I just think ""Nemo and Turkey Burgers""."
21442,success,Black-ish,- Yep.
21443,success,Black-ish,- Thank you.
21444,success,Black-ish,You're welcome.
21445,success,Black-ish,What?
21446,success,Black-ish,Don't you think that's beautiful?
21447,success,Black-ish,They don't see color.
21448,success,Black-ish,No.
21449,success,Black-ish,I think they need to be tested.
21450,success,Black-ish,"But when I say it, I'm wrong."
21451,success,Black-ish,I made the team!
21452,success,Black-ish,Whoo!
21453,success,Black-ish,Yes!
21454,success,Black-ish,"Oh, my goodness!"
21455,success,Black-ish,- That's so exciting!
21456,success,Black-ish,- Of course you did.
21457,success,Black-ish,- Yes!
21458,success,Black-ish,"Oh, God, I'm so happy!"
21459,success,Black-ish,- Thank you.
21460,success,Black-ish,"Uh, Zach?"
21461,success,Black-ish,Can I help you with something?
21462,success,Black-ish,"Uh, yeah, I've just been craving some grape soda all day, and my parents just never buy any."
21463,success,Black-ish,- And why would you assume we have - Found it!
21464,success,Black-ish,"Oh, and, dad, me and some of the field mob decided what I should do - for my birthday party."
21465,success,Black-ish,- Field mob?
21466,success,Black-ish,- I want to have a Bar Mitzvah.
21467,success,Black-ish,"- A And before you say anything, I know we're not Jewish, but Zach knows a rabbi who's great at pushing through conversions, so Hold on so you'd be willing to forsake your own religion to have a party?"
21468,success,Black-ish,Short answer yes.
21469,success,Black-ish,- Are you listening to this?
21470,success,Black-ish,"- Dad, now that I think about it, if I do, you won't have to worry about anyone calling me ""Andy"" anymore, because when I convert, I'll get a Hebrew name."
21471,success,Black-ish,"I'm gonna go with either ""Scholomo"" or ""Shmuel""."
21472,success,Black-ish,- What?
21473,success,Black-ish,"- Both pretty solid, bro."
21474,success,Black-ish,Shut up!
21475,success,Black-ish,Shut you know what?
21476,success,Black-ish,Family meeting!
21477,success,Black-ish,"Everybody, 'round the table now!"
21478,success,Black-ish,I smell a group hug coming on.
21479,success,Black-ish,I'm going to the track.
21480,success,Black-ish,"See you later, Pops."
21481,success,Black-ish,"All right, listen up."
21482,success,Black-ish,"I may have to be ""Urban"" at work, but I'm still going to need my family to be black."
21483,success,Black-ish,Not Black-ish - Wha - but black.
21484,success,Black-ish,So we're gonna start with some strict guidelines.
21485,success,Black-ish,"So, then he sent me a smiley face with a wink."
21486,success,Black-ish,"- I mean, I should be offended, right?"
21487,success,Black-ish,- Zoey!
21488,success,Black-ish,- I'll text you.
21489,success,Black-ish,- Alright.
21490,success,Black-ish,"From heretoforth, we are going to keep it real."
21491,success,Black-ish,"So, Junior, if I hear anybody calling you ""Scholomo"" or ""Shmuel"" or especially ""Andy,"" I'm gonna back you over and whoever else is saying it in my car."
21492,success,Black-ish,- Dad - Quiet!
21493,success,Black-ish,"Now, I may have to watch you play possibly the dumbest sport in the world, but I do not have to sit back and listen to you rave about other kids' Bar Mitzvahs."
21494,success,Black-ish,"So, next Saturday, when you turn 13, you're becoming a man, too a black man, because I'm throwing you an African rites of passage ceremony."
21495,success,Black-ish,That does not sound as fun.
21496,success,Black-ish,"No, it does not."
21497,success,Black-ish,"Okay, I have an idea."
21498,success,Black-ish,Why don't we take a black break and go get some white yogurt?
21499,success,Black-ish,- Yeah!
21500,success,Black-ish,- Yeah!
21501,success,Black-ish,"Hey, hey!"
21502,success,Black-ish,"Hold on, hold on."
21503,success,Black-ish,"Slow your roll, you two."
21504,success,Black-ish,"From here on out, I'm gonna need you two to describe people using keeping-it-real identifications."
21505,success,Black-ish,"""The assailant was a hispanic male between the ages of 10 and 60""."
21506,success,Black-ish,See?
21507,success,Black-ish,Now I know who I'm looking for.
21508,success,Black-ish,"Mommy, daddy's scaring me."
21509,success,Black-ish,"Me too, baby."
21510,success,Black-ish,Me too.
21511,success,Black-ish,Really?
21512,success,Black-ish,"Okay, are we done with this whole life-and-death, keeping-it-real speech?"
21513,success,Black-ish,Because I need to start prepping for a and I'm not gonna be thinking about keeping it real.
21514,success,Black-ish,I'm gonna be thinking about keeping him alive.
21515,success,Black-ish,You're not the only one in this house with an important job.
21516,success,Black-ish,My job is pretty important.
21517,success,Black-ish,"And, as I recall, you were the one who brought up this keeping-it-real argument."
21518,success,Black-ish,- So this is my fault?
21519,success,Black-ish,"- Yes, it's your fault."
21520,success,Black-ish,"- Oh, this is my fault?"
21521,success,Black-ish,"- Oh, yes."
21522,success,Black-ish,"And, tomorrow, I have a very important presentation to make."
21523,success,Black-ish,And you know what I'm gonna do when I go in there?
21524,success,Black-ish,"I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna keep it real as Yeah, because that's what you told me to do."
21525,success,Black-ish,"Oh, I'm pretty sure that's not what I told you to do."
21526,success,Black-ish,"Oh, no, that's exactly what you said."
21527,success,Black-ish,"If she thinks I'm finished with keeping it real, I am just getting started."
21528,success,Black-ish,"And if Stevens & Lido really wants an Urban SVP, i'll give them their Urban SVP."
21529,success,Black-ish,- Ha!
21530,success,Black-ish,"- Oh, my God."
21531,success,Black-ish,Lalonde Leonard landing at will.
21532,success,Black-ish,And Lalonde goes down!
21533,success,Black-ish,"_ So, that's my Urban pitch for the L. A. tourism account."
21534,success,Black-ish,Thoughts?
21535,success,Black-ish,"We're not really doing this, right?"
21536,success,Black-ish,I thought it was funny.
21537,success,Black-ish,"Operation ""Keepin' It Real"" was in full effect, and although it was off to a rocky start, I still had high hopes."
21538,success,Black-ish,Andre.
21539,success,Black-ish,- Yes?
21540,success,Black-ish,- What is this mess you're doing?
21541,success,Black-ish,"This ain't no mess, Pops."
21542,success,Black-ish,This is our culture.
21543,success,Black-ish,This ain't our culture.
21544,success,Black-ish,"We black, not African."
21545,success,Black-ish,Africans don't even like us.
21546,success,Black-ish,"Dad, can I go?"
21547,success,Black-ish,No.
21548,success,Black-ish,Stand right there and experience your roots.
21549,success,Black-ish,"You're better off watching ""Roots""."
21550,success,Black-ish,"Should I start, or do you want to?"
21551,success,Black-ish,Okay.
21552,success,Black-ish,Okay.
21553,success,Black-ish,"Uh, take that, son."
21554,success,Black-ish,Take that!
21555,success,Black-ish,- What is he doing?
21556,success,Black-ish,- Don't look at me.
21557,success,Black-ish,"Hey, Bow."
21558,success,Black-ish,"Look, baby, I had the boy wanted a Bar Mitzvah!"
21559,success,Black-ish,"Bow, I could use your support right now."
21560,success,Black-ish,"I was trying to support you when I called you at work today, and my call was rerouted to Corporate Security."
21561,success,Black-ish,And they questioned me for like 30 minutes about my husband's mental state.
21562,success,Black-ish,Hmm.
21563,success,Black-ish,Weird.
21564,success,Black-ish,"Next time, just call my cell."
21565,success,Black-ish,Ohh.
21566,success,Black-ish,"Dre, what happened at work today?"
21567,success,Black-ish,"Look, Mr. Stevens failed to fully grasp the irony of my pitch, so we mutually decided that we would take the weekend to figure out if Stevens & Lido was still a perfect fit for me."
21568,success,Black-ish,Still a perfect fit?
21569,success,Black-ish,Dre?
21570,success,Black-ish,He's thinking about firing you?
21571,success,Black-ish,"I guess, if you want to oversimplify it like that."
21572,success,Black-ish,"Oh, my God."
21573,success,Black-ish,Dre!
21574,success,Black-ish,There is no winning with you!
21575,success,Black-ish,You're upset because they gave you the job because you're black.
21576,success,Black-ish,"If they'd given it to someone white, you'd be upset they didn't give it to someone black!"
21577,success,Black-ish,"This ""keeping it real"" B. S. has got to stop."
21578,success,Black-ish,I'm not gonna have you running around torturing my son.
21579,success,Black-ish,What was that?
21580,success,Black-ish,What are you wear what are you wearing?
21581,success,Black-ish,"Whatever issues you are working through, you need to get over them now."
21582,success,Black-ish,Okay?
21583,success,Black-ish,Nice shot.
21584,success,Black-ish,So much for The Johnson Family form.
21585,success,Black-ish,"Dad, listen, I get it."
21586,success,Black-ish,You feel like I'm turning into a white boy.
21587,success,Black-ish,But I'm not.
21588,success,Black-ish,I'm just being me.
21589,success,Black-ish,I'm just not quite sure who that is yet.
21590,success,Black-ish,"Son, I realize how difficult it must be to feel like the different one at school."
21591,success,Black-ish,But it's also important for you to hold on to your culture and realize how special it is.
21592,success,Black-ish,"Honestly, the only thing I'm really trying to hold on to right now is my first boob."
21593,success,Black-ish,I'm a ninth-grader playing varsity.
21594,success,Black-ish,That means something.
21595,success,Black-ish,So this was all a part of your plan.
21596,success,Black-ish,Yeah.
21597,success,Black-ish,"Me and the field mob Hey, son, please stop calling yourselves that."
21598,success,Black-ish,Fine.
21599,success,Black-ish,"Me and my boys figured that if we could just get our foot in the door with other jocks, we'd really get in there and make some noise."
21600,success,Black-ish,"So, you really do want to play basketball."
21601,success,Black-ish,"Yeah, dad."
21602,success,Black-ish,But I suck at it.
21603,success,Black-ish,"All right, little man, get in the house."
21604,success,Black-ish,Go.
21605,success,Black-ish,Who knew?
21606,success,Black-ish,Boy wants to hold a boob.
21607,success,Black-ish,You can't be mad at him for that.
21608,success,Black-ish,"Hey, Pops, how the hell did you keep it real with us - when we were growing up?"
21609,success,Black-ish,- I didn't.
21610,success,Black-ish,I kept it honest.
21611,success,Black-ish,"So, I really screwed this up, didn't I?"
21612,success,Black-ish,"Screwing things up is just another part of what it means to be a father, Dre."
21613,success,Black-ish,It's how you learn to fix things.
21614,success,Black-ish,"Just remember, son, whatever you do, make sure it's right for who you are."
21615,success,Black-ish,"If that boy wants a Bar Mitzvah, I'm gonna throw that boy a Bar Mitzvah."
21616,success,Black-ish,There you go.
21617,success,Black-ish,"""Hold a boob""."
21618,success,Black-ish,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Andre Jr. 's Hip-Hop Bro Mitzvah."
21619,success,Black-ish,.
21620,success,Black-ish,"Sometimes keeping it real means admitting you were wrong but, as a dad, still finding a way to be right."
21621,success,Black-ish,"Be damned if I'm calling him Andy, though."
21622,success,Black-ish,"So, that Los Angeles tourism campaign went a lot better once I realized that ""Urban"" can also mean Hip, Cool, and Colorful, just like my family."
21623,success,Black-ish,"So, taking a cue from my very wise son, I decided to get my foot in the door and really make some noise."
21624,success,Black-ish,"And just like that, I became the SVP of Stevens & Lido's Urban Division."
21625,success,Black-ish,The funny thing is I didn't feel Urban.
21626,success,Black-ish,I just feel like a dad.
21627,success,Black-ish,who was willing to do whatever he had to for his family.
21628,success,Black-ish,And isn't that the American Dream?
21629,success,The Office,"All right, Jim."
21630,success,The Office,Your quarterlies look very good.
21631,success,The Office,- How are things at the library?

21651,success,The Office,My mistake.
21652,success,The Office,"That was a woman I was talking to, so She had a very low voice."
21653,success,The Office,"Probably a smoker, so So that's the way it's done."
21654,success,The Office,"I've, er, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager."
21655,success,The Office,If you want to come through here We have the entire floor.

21677,success,The Office,People say I am the best boss.
21678,success,The Office,"They go, ""We've never worked in a place like this."
21679,success,The Office,You're hilarious.
21680,success,The Office,"""And you get the best out of us."
21681,success,The Office,""" I think that pretty much sums it up."
21682,success,The Office,I found it at Spencer Gifts.
21683,success,The Office,Shall I play for you?
21684,success,The Office,"Pa rum pum pum pum I have no gifts for you Pa rum pum pum pum My job is to speak to clients on the phone about er, quantities and type of copier paper."
21685,success,The Office,"You know, whether we can supply it to them."

22752,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Well, your new Captain does."
22753,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders."
22754,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Everyone, I'm your new commanding officer, - Captain Ray Holt."

22766,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me Though you were significantly Fatter, sir."
22767,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"They called me ""Terry Titties."
22768,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,""" Because I had large, uh Titties, yes."
22769,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I remember.
22770,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I never liked that nickname.
22771,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Though to be fair, it was accurate."
22772,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave?
22773,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls."
22774,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Cagney and Lacey.
22775,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,They have adorable chubby cheeks.
22776,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt."
22777,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Lost my edge.
22778,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,There was an incident in a department store.
22779,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Hey, man, you okay?"
22780,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,You look a little jumpy.

22787,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Um Well, Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels."
22788,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"They're pretty much worthless, but they make good coffee."

22791,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Rosa Diaz.
22792,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary."
22793,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Tell me who has me for secret santa.
22794,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,No!
22795,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,That takes all the fun out of it.
22796,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,It's Scully.
22797,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,He got you a scarf.
22798,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- I'll make him return it.
22799,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"- Yes, you will."
22800,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Charles Boyle.
22801,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,He's a grinder.
22802,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Not the most brilliant Detective, but he works harder than anyone else."
22803,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,He's not physically gifted.
22804,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Oh, man!"
22805,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,My muffin.
22806,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Ahh!

22813,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Careful.
22814,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,That stuff's pretty hot.
22815,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Oh, is it?"
22816,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Hmm?
22817,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year.
22818,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up."
22819,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Tell me about Peralta.
22820,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Jacob Peralta is my best Detective.
22821,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles.
22822,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.
22823,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,That was very well put.
22824,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I've talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.
22825,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Look, you know my history."
22826,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,You know how important this is to me.
22827,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"This precinct is doing fine, but I wanna make it the best one in Brooklyn."
22828,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,And I need your help.
22829,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Absolutely, sir."
22830,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Where do we start?
22831,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,What is happening?
22832,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,We start with him.
22833,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Okay, so the perp came in through the window, left the muddy red footprint, and apparently had sex with the dish rack."
22834,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Shell casing found here.
22835,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Two shots.
22836,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Bang, bang."
22837,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Great work, Detective."
22838,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,You get a tie.
22839,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Hey, that's mine."
22840,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,You took it from my desk.
22841,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"That's right, Charles."
22842,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Good solve.
22843,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Tie for you.
22844,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Thanks!
22845,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Now everyone be sure to put those on because it's impossible to solve crimes - unless you're wearing a tie.
22846,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Lay off the Captain.
22847,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,That man is gonna be my rabbi.
22848,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Okay, first of all, when you use the word ""rabbi,"" you know that turns me on and that's unfair in the work environment."
22849,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass."
22850,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Yeah, he's a little too serious."
22851,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"- What do you think, Rosa?"
22852,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- He seems cool.
22853,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Yeah, he seems cool."
22854,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I agree.
22855,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon Iberico ham, valued at what!"
22856,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"$6,000."
22857,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"$6,000 for a ham?"
22858,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Jamon Iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain.
22859,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,They had it at my uncle's funeral.
22860,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I gorged myself at that funeral.
22861,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I mean, I was constipated for three days."
22862,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Wow, that's a great story, Charles, thank you."
22863,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"All right, listen up, everybody."
22864,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Better contact Captain Holt, let him know we got a ten-tie situation."
22865,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Speaking of ties, where's yours, meep morp?"
22866,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,This is fantastic.
22867,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Captain!
22868,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Hey!
22869,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Welcome to the murder.
22870,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,What are you doing here?
22871,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I like to know what my detectives are up to.
22872,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- That okay by you?
22873,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Yep.
22874,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Take Santiago and knock on doors.
22875,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,See if the neighbors heard anything.
22876,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Door duty?
22877,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,It's a waste of time.
22878,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Diaz and Boyle.
22879,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Check in the coroner.
22880,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Report back to me in an hour.
22881,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- That went well.
22882,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"- No, it didn't."
22883,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,He's got like super hearing.
22884,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Hey, Rosa!"
22885,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Rosa.
22886,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Rosa!
22887,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week."
22888,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Wanna go?
22889,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Sure.
22890,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Cool!
22891,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Awesome.
22892,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,There's a bunch of movie options.
22893,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.
22894,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Citizen Kane is terrible.
22895,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Pick a good movie.
22896,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Good call.
22897,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Smart.
22898,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I'll do it.
22899,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.
22900,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,So Gina Civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground.
22901,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?
22902,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I will tell you on six conditions.
22903,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves."
22904,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Second How about this?
22905,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- If you tell me - Mm-hmm.
22906,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I won't have you suspended Without pay.
22907,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Oh, that sounds great."
22908,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car."
22909,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"It's an old Mustang, and it's pretty sweet."
22910,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him."
22911,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,He guarantees it will end in sex.
22912,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I bet on at least some over-the-clothes action.
22913,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"At the very least, some touching - No, that's enough, Gina."
22914,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Caresses.
22915,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I could see him showing up in a silk robe.
22916,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"- That's enough, Gina."
22917,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- All right.
22918,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Thank you.
22919,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Let the wasting of time begin.

22927,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"'Cause a dude broke in, smoked weed, and bolted."
22928,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,It's Do you think it's the same dude that left that bong there on the floor?

22941,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"All right, got it."
22942,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Have you seen this man before?
22943,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,He was shot last night.
22944,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Oh.
22945,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Thank you.

22949,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Wall Street journal on the doormat Top floor apartment.
22950,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"like a hot, eligible bachelor."
22951,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I'll take that action.
22952,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Police!

22959,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,No surprises from the coroner.
22960,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"A few gunshots, shoulder and chest."
22961,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,None of the neighbors heard or saw anything.
22962,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"And what's worse, Santiago struck out with a 92-year-old."
22963,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"That is not accurate, sir."
22964,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Wait, you hooked up with him?"
22965,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Ugh!
22966,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"All right, hit the pawn shops and canvass the neighborhood."
22967,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"And while you're out, you can buy yourself a tie."
22968,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Oh, actually, sir I'm wearing a tie right now."
22969,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Check it out.
22970,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Secret tie.
22971,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"First of all, I think you're kind of overdoing it with the manscaping."
22972,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"But more importantly, Detective, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously?"
22973,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Does anyone here know why it's so important to me that you all dress appropriately?
22974,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Hmm.
22975,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Four highly trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery.
22976,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I wanna be briefed on any new developments.
22977,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Any questions?
22978,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I was gonna ask you if you thought I was doing too much manscaping, but we solved that one."
22979,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,So I'm good.
22980,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Hey, Boyle."
22981,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Yep.
22982,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- What about this fancy ham stuff?
22983,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Jamon Iberico.
22984,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Yes.
22985,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,The perp left a really expensive TV but then stole ham?
22986,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,It doesn't make sense.
22987,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Is there a place nearby the crime scene that sells it?
22988,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Beneficio's might.
22989,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Let's go.
22990,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,You gotta brief the C. O. first.
22991,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,We'll brief him after we catch the guy.
22992,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,My name is Ratko.
22993,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I don't know anything.
22994,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Oh, okay."

22997,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- No.
22998,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Maybe actually look at the picture.
22999,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I don't know him.
23000,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I don't know what happened.
23001,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,No more questions.
23002,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Well, why don't I run a scenario past you, Ratko, and you tell me what you think?"
23003,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,You do know Morgenthau.
23004,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,He came in here and tried to sell you some hams.
23005,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"You knew they were worth a lotta money, so you tried to steal them from him when he wasn't home."
23006,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Only he was home, so you shot him."
23007,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Does that sound familiar?
23008,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Uh, maybe some role play will jog your memory?"
23009,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Great idea.
23010,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"- Okay, yeah."
23011,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Okay.
23012,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- So I'm I'm Ratko.

23027,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- On it!
23028,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Ratko!

23038,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Jake!
23039,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Little help!
23040,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Ratko!
23041,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"He's not going anywhere, Jake!"
23042,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Ratko!
23043,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I got him!
23044,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I got him!
23045,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Don't worry!
23046,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"So no, I did not brief you."
23047,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"And yes, he did get away."
23048,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,But some bonus good news I got you hazelnut.
23049,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,And A little spoon there for you.
23050,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Is he seriously assigning me to the records room?
23051,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I mean, why do we even have a records room?"
23052,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Computer's been invented, right?"
23053,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I didn't dream it?
23054,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"You're lucky, man."
23055,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I wish I could get assigned here full-time.
23056,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,You could not be farther from the action.
23057,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Sergeant, you know me."
23058,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I have more arrests than anyone.
23059,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Will you please tell the Captain how dumb it is to lock his best Detective in a file cabinet?
23060,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- Second best.
23061,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,- You're wrong about Holt.
23062,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know.
23063,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"In 1981, he caught the disco strangler."
23064,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"It's over, disco man!"
23065,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl.

23069,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Gonna be hard to win our bet when you're on the bench, Peralta."
23070,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Although I did start a new category.
23071,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"""Murderers we let go."
23072,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,""" And look at that."
23073,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,You're winning.

23076,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Have fun with your face!
23077,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Slam!

23079,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,So what movie did you get us tickets to?
23080,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them."
23081,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Just to be safe?
23082,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,What does that mean?
23083,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I don't know, I didn't wanna mess up."
23084,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Because you're sort of Opinionated.
23085,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,You think I'm opinionated?
23086,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Okay, here's an opinion for you."

23157,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I made Captain.

23195,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"No, Ratko, shut up."
23196,success,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,It's important to you because you were kept off the team for so long.

24365,success,Archer,Try to include people in your life and then you Lana.
24366,success,Archer,Hey.
24367,success,Archer,"Hey, what does this smell like?"
24368,success,Archer,Like the dysfunctional asshole I broke up with six months ago.
24369,success,Archer,"Oh, my God."
24370,success,Archer,You're amazing.
24371,success,Archer,"You are amazing, sweet stuff."
24372,success,Archer,Wanna do it again and put on some interracial porn?
24373,success,Archer,"God, it's like my brain's that tree, and you're those little cookie elves."
24374,success,Archer,Just a second.
24375,success,Archer,"- No, baby, don't answer that."
24376,success,Archer,- I have to.
24377,success,Archer,"Sorry, it's Mother."
24378,success,Archer,"- Mother, hey."
24379,success,Archer,Just a second.
24380,success,Archer,- I cannot believe you.
24381,success,Archer,"No, turn it on."
24382,success,Archer,I can do both.
24383,success,Archer,- What?
24384,success,Archer,"- So don't speak to me, ever."
24385,success,Archer,"And while you're not ever speaking to me, jump up your own ass and die."
24386,success,Archer,"Oh, rea After all that H. R. Mediation."
24387,success,Archer,Really?
24388,success,Archer,- Yup.
24389,success,Archer,- After all the hard work Pam did.
24390,success,Archer,- Is that Archer?
24391,success,Archer,- Goddamn it.
24392,success,Archer,"- Archer, hey."
24393,success,Archer,- Go away.
24394,success,Archer,"- About your operations account - Not - Cyril, not now."
24395,success,Archer,"- Yes, now."
24396,success,Archer,- Not a good time.
24397,success,Archer,- You've got serious discrepancies in your account.
24398,success,Archer,"- No, Cyril."
24399,success,Archer,I'm sure you wouldn't use operational funds for personal expenses.
24400,success,Archer,"Come on, 22 black."
24401,success,Archer,Twenty-two black.
24402,success,Archer,Twenty-two.
24403,success,Archer,Black.
24404,success,Archer,Ass.
24405,success,Archer,Son of a bitch.
24406,success,Archer,Heh.
24407,success,Archer,"Not you, giant African man."
24408,success,Archer,I'm sorry.
24409,success,Archer,Can I offer you a drink?
24410,success,Archer,How about this expensive prostitute?
24411,success,Archer,"That is a very serious implication, Cyril."
24412,success,Archer,"Well, so is embezzlement."
24413,success,Archer,Yeah?
24414,success,Archer,"Well, so is the fact that you, some crazy-how, are screwing my ex."
24415,success,Archer,"- Archer, please."
24416,success,Archer,That's private.
24417,success,Archer,- Not calm enough?
24418,success,Archer,"You all know about Cyril and Lana, right?"
24419,success,Archer,"Of course, because if Pam knows, then everybody knows because of Pam's huge mouth."
24420,success,Archer,"Right, Pam?"
24421,success,Archer,"H. R. Mediations are supposed to be confidential, Pam, you manatee."
24422,success,Archer,"- And as for you, Cyril, good day, sir."
24423,success,Archer,- Archer.
24424,success,Archer,"Hey, wait."
24425,success,Archer,What about your account?
24426,success,Archer,"Oh, I get it."
24427,success,Archer,Classic misdirection.
24428,success,Archer,"No, don't."
24429,success,Archer,You're so ugly when you cry.
24430,success,Archer,- Mr. Archer.
24431,success,Archer,- I'm fine.
24432,success,Archer,Is she in or out eating a baby?
24433,success,Archer,- You stood me up again last night.
24434,success,Archer,- Last?
24435,success,Archer,"Oh, yeah."
24436,success,Archer,"Oh, my."
24437,success,Archer,What happened was Did you see Brian's Song?
24438,success,Archer,Same thing pretty much happened.
24439,success,Archer,I helped a guy with cancer.
24440,success,Archer,"Look, I'm really sorry, Carol, but I couldn't It's Cheryl."
24441,success,Archer,"I know, Ca Cheryl."
24442,success,Archer,So to make it up to you - I'm ready.
24443,success,Archer,could you buzz me in?
24444,success,Archer,Ugh.
24445,success,Archer,Is that all you have to say?
24446,success,Archer,Yes.
24447,success,Archer,"Now tell me again how No, not that part."
24448,success,Archer,Go back.
24449,success,Archer,Yes.
24450,success,Archer,The pepper.
24451,success,Archer,"Oh, yes, God."
24452,success,Archer,"Oh, God."
24453,success,Archer,"Oh, goddamn it."
24454,success,Archer,What the hell are you doing?
24455,success,Archer,What are you doing?
24456,success,Archer,"L I'm For your information, I've just been reviewing your operations account."
24457,success,Archer,- No.
24458,success,Archer,No.
24459,success,Archer,No.
24460,success,Archer,- Yes.
24461,success,Archer,Yes.
24462,success,Archer,- Yes.
24463,success,Archer,Yes.
24464,success,Archer,- No.
24465,success,Archer,No.
24466,success,Archer,And it makes for fascinating reading.
24467,success,Archer,- No.
24468,success,Archer,- Let's see.
24469,success,Archer,You turned in an expense report from Berlin where the German desk says you never checked in.
24470,success,Archer,"- Oh, Berlin was - Ditto Buenos Aires."
24471,success,Archer,- Too busy to check in?
24472,success,Archer,- There was Yeah.
24473,success,Archer,Already off to Monaco?
24474,success,Archer,- I'm spying.
24475,success,Archer,- Or was it Mallorca?
24476,success,Archer,Oh.
24477,success,Archer,- Or Tunis?
24478,success,Archer,- Tunis kind of rings a bell.
24479,success,Archer,ISIS isn't your own personal travel agency.
24480,success,Archer,It doesn't exist just so you can jet off to Whore Island.
24481,success,Archer,That's not a real place.
24482,success,Archer,I have 50 agents who'd literally kill to move up to your position.
24483,success,Archer,If you don't square your operations account by Monday they won't need to.
24484,success,Archer,Your position will be vacant.
24485,success,Archer,- Sterling.
24486,success,Archer,- Hm?
24487,success,Archer,Sorry.
24488,success,Archer,I was picturing Whore Island.
24489,success,Archer,Have I made myself clear?
24490,success,Archer,Are you?
24491,success,Archer,"You're looking for the answer ""yes""?"
24492,success,Archer,- Yes.
24493,success,Archer,Good.
24494,success,Archer,"- Then, yes."
24495,success,Archer,Then get out.
24496,success,Archer,"And for God's sake, take a shower."
24497,success,Archer,Smells like a whorehouse in here.
24498,success,Archer,Okay.
24499,success,Archer,Your own fingers.
24500,success,Archer,- Hm?
24501,success,Archer,- Nothing.
24502,success,Archer,Johnny Bench called.
24503,success,Archer,So here's the thing.
24504,success,Archer,I need to access my operations account and you're preventing that.
24505,success,Archer,"Now, we can do this easy or we can do it hard."
24506,success,Archer,Your call.
24507,success,Archer,No?
24508,success,Archer,Hard it is then.
24509,success,Archer,"- Oh, God, sorry."
24510,success,Archer,"Goddamn it, Archer."
24511,success,Archer,- I forgot that Did I get you?
24512,success,Archer,What is wrong with you?
24513,success,Archer,Me?
24514,success,Archer,Nothing.
24515,success,Archer,"You, on the other hand, have a bullet inside you."
24516,success,Archer,- I see the foot's all better.
24517,success,Archer,- And I see you're still a hatchet-face prick.
24518,success,Archer,- Do you see that sign?
24519,success,Archer,- Do you see that sign?
24520,success,Archer,- Well - That's why.
24521,success,Archer,So we don't get ants.
24522,success,Archer,"Because when your co-workers put food in the refrigerator that's a bond of trust, okay?"
24523,success,Archer,"And if you violate that trust, or the food, there's There's my favorite section head."
24524,success,Archer,I am dealing with the break room problem.
24525,success,Archer,"Oh, good."
24526,success,Archer,"You caught the Oh, wait I had something for this."
24527,success,Archer,- The Pita Predator.
24528,success,Archer,- You know what?
24529,success,Archer,Sorry.
24530,success,Archer,Let's just call it what it is.
24531,success,Archer,- Food rapist.
24532,success,Archer,"- Not a pretty name, is it?"
24533,success,Archer,"Pam, if you want some food that's supposed to be cream-filled I offer these delicious doughnuts."
24534,success,Archer,Yeah?
24535,success,Archer,- In exchange for a favor.
24536,success,Archer,- A favor?
24537,success,Archer,- Yeah.
24538,success,Archer,After how you treated me?
24539,success,Archer,"- **** your dolphin, Pam."
24540,success,Archer,"Archer, she's down, all right?"
24541,success,Archer,- Your ******* dolphin.
24542,success,Archer,She's tapping out.
24543,success,Archer,- You.
24544,success,Archer,- I think she peed.
24545,success,Archer,I had to get three stitches.
24546,success,Archer,And I broke my watch.
24547,success,Archer,And I'm sorry for that.
24548,success,Archer,"- Three - But I need your help, Pam, because I'm um, conducting a mole hunt."
24549,success,Archer,- Aah.
24550,success,Archer,"- Gasp you should because if you let me in the mainframe, I'll drop these doughnuts."
24551,success,Archer,"Then you can pretend they're marbles and you're a hungry, hungry hungry hippo."
24552,success,Archer,Lana.
24553,success,Archer,"Hey, I know I'm supposed to be up my own ass right now but - Oh, is that what you want?"
24554,success,Archer,Yup.
24555,success,Archer,- Because that's how you get ants.
24556,success,Archer,Yay.
24557,success,Archer,"Cyril, my favorite section head."
24558,success,Archer,- What do you want?
24559,success,Archer,- To apologize for my behavior.
24560,success,Archer,- Well - And also to - What are you doing?
24561,success,Archer,"- Oh, just dicing veggies for dinner."
24562,success,Archer,- I always make Lana stir-fry on Friday.
24563,success,Archer,- Neat.
24564,success,Archer,Listen - Guess what we call it.
24565,success,Archer,- Stir Friday?
24566,success,Archer,"- Wow, that's actually better."
24567,success,Archer,- Yup.
24568,success,Archer,It's all yours.
24569,success,Archer,So come let me in the mainframe.
24570,success,Archer,Is this about your operations account?
24571,success,Archer,- No.
24572,success,Archer,Cyril - Yeah?
24573,success,Archer,I'm on a top-secret mole hunt.
24574,success,Archer,"Oh, yeah, Pam mentioned that."
24575,success,Archer,- Wha?
24576,success,Archer,When?
24577,success,Archer,"- Well, she called a minute ago."
24578,success,Archer,- You know how Pam loves to gossip.
24579,success,Archer,- Yeah.
24580,success,Archer,I need rug marbles.
24581,success,Archer,I know.
24582,success,Archer,- Come let me into the mainframe.
24583,success,Archer,- Okay.
24584,success,Archer,- I need to confirm this with your mother.
24585,success,Archer,- No.
24586,success,Archer,No.
24587,success,Archer,"I mean, what?"
24588,success,Archer,Cyril.
24589,success,Archer,- What if she is the mole?
24590,success,Archer,Think about it.
24591,success,Archer,- Your own mother.
24592,success,Archer,Think what that would do to me if we had to kill her - Archer.
24593,success,Archer,by stabbing her wrinkly neck with a knife?
24594,success,Archer,- Yeah.
24595,success,Archer,I can't let you in there.
24596,success,Archer,Can't or won't?
24597,success,Archer,- Either?
24598,success,Archer,- And after I gave you Stir Friday.
24599,success,Archer,- That is much better.
24600,success,Archer,- I know.
24601,success,Archer,- But if you wanna access the mainframe - What?
24602,success,Archer,I guess you'd have to break in.
24603,success,Archer,Break in to the ISIS mainframe.
24604,success,Archer,Which is obviously ludicrous.
24605,success,Archer,As is this baby corn.
24606,success,Archer,What is that about?
24607,success,Archer,Archer?
24608,success,Archer,ISIS headquarters makes Fort Knox look like a gingerbread house.
24609,success,Archer,Only two means of ingress.
24610,success,Archer,"The first, at street level."
24611,success,Archer,Impenetrable after 6.
24612,success,Archer,"The second, through an access door on the roof."
24613,success,Archer,Inexplicably unprotected.
24614,success,Archer,But even if you zip-lined across reached the access door and somehow made it into ISIS headquarters you'd still have to find the mainframe.
24615,success,Archer,"But, wait, it gets worse."
24616,success,Archer,"Inside, there are three countermeasure systems."
24617,success,Archer,The first is pressure sensitive in the floor.
24618,success,Archer,Even a mouse triggers it.
24619,success,Archer,The second is sound sensitive.
24620,success,Archer,Anything above a whisper sets it off.
24621,success,Archer,And the third system is state-of-the-art voice activation.
24622,success,Archer,Cyril Figgis.
24623,success,Archer,"So, obviously, it would be a lot easier for me if you just disabled all that when you left work tonight somehow."
24624,success,Archer,- Ooh.
24625,success,Archer,That would make me uncomfortable.
24626,success,Archer,- Yeah.
24627,success,Archer,"Oh, God, everything makes you uncomfortable."
24628,success,Archer,Just the tip?
24629,success,Archer,Just the tip.
24630,success,Archer,Just the tip.
24631,success,Archer,How was I to know you're lactose intolerant?
24632,success,Archer,Because I kept screaming it.
24633,success,Archer,"- Well, what?"
24634,success,Archer,- And this I'm just a secretary.
24635,success,Archer,- I don't have access to security whatevers.
24636,success,Archer,- What?
24637,success,Archer,- Then get them from Cyril.
24638,success,Archer,- How would I do that?
24639,success,Archer,"- Seduce him or Pam, or both."
24640,success,Archer,- I can't do that.
24641,success,Archer,- Can't or won't?
24642,success,Archer,- Either.
24643,success,Archer,That's how you wanna play it?
24644,success,Archer,Fine.
24645,success,Archer,- Are you gonna pay for your lunch?
24646,success,Archer,- Just the tip.
24647,success,Archer,"Actually, I don't have any cash."
24648,success,Archer,Can you get it?
24649,success,Archer,Sorry.
24650,success,Archer,I also need cab fare.
24651,success,Archer,"Oh, ugly duckling."
24652,success,Archer,"Bock, bock."
24653,success,Archer,"So thanks for nothing, Carol."
24654,success,Archer,Now I have to break into ISIS headquarters in a $900 turtleneck.
24655,success,Archer,"And if it gets ruined I'm gonna make you drink heavy cream, you Carol."
24656,success,Archer,"Wow, that was actually pretty easy."
24657,success,Archer,"Thanks, new turtleneck."
24658,success,Archer,"Oh, and thank you, duffel bag."
24659,success,Archer,"Jesus, what else could go wrong?"
24660,success,Archer,Exactly.
24661,success,Archer,You're not Archer.
24662,success,Archer,That's what's so great about you.
24663,success,Archer,And the fact your mother died in a fire.
24664,success,Archer,- What?
24665,success,Archer,- I said where are we on that stir-fry?
24666,success,Archer,Agent Kane.
24667,success,Archer,What?
24668,success,Archer,"Yes, confirmed."
24669,success,Archer,Confirmed a naughty nellie's breaking our after-work phone rule.
24670,success,Archer,"- Cyril, there's been a break-in at ISIS."
24671,success,Archer,- What?
24672,success,Archer,- Think it's the mole?
24673,success,Archer,"- God, you and Pam - Pam's all right."
24674,success,Archer,- Wow.
24675,success,Archer,Okay.
24676,success,Archer,I've got to go.
24677,success,Archer,- But it's Stir Friday.
24678,success,Archer,- Hurray.
24679,success,Archer,- But if I'm not here - Yeah.
24680,success,Archer,Because after three months of whatever it is we're doing it's weird that you can't leave me alone in your apartment.
24681,success,Archer,"- I know I have trust issues, all right?"
24682,success,Archer,- But it's - It's Archer's fault I'm like this.
24683,success,Archer,- Here we go.
24684,success,Archer,- All of those years of lying and cheating.
24685,success,Archer,- It's fine.
24686,success,Archer,That thing with the mayonnaise.
24687,success,Archer,- How messed up he is about his mother.
24688,success,Archer,- Fine.
24689,success,Archer,Do you know he called out her name once when we f?
24690,success,Archer,Fine!
24691,success,Archer,- And here we are.
24692,success,Archer,All fine.
24693,success,Archer,"- Cyril, come on, hon, please?"
24694,success,Archer,Now who's a naughty nellie?
24695,success,Archer,- Hello?
24696,success,Archer,"Hi, who's this?"
24697,success,Archer,Cyril Figgis.
24698,success,Archer,I'm sorry.
24699,success,Archer,Did you say Faggis?
24700,success,Archer,- Figgis.
24701,success,Archer,Figgis.
24702,success,Archer,- Who is it?
24703,success,Archer,Better not be Pam.
24704,success,Archer,Not Faggis?
24705,success,Archer,- Figgis.
24706,success,Archer,I was very clear.
24707,success,Archer,"Hi, I'm a huge fan of cock and my name is Cyril Figgis."
24708,success,Archer,Holy shit.
24709,success,Archer,Our security is atrocious.
24710,success,Archer,"Seriously, it's really bad."
24711,success,Archer,Password.
24712,success,Archer,Hm.
24713,success,Archer,Password.
24714,success,Archer,"How about ""guest""?"
24715,success,Archer,No way.
24716,success,Archer,It can't be.
24717,success,Archer,"Jesus Christ, that is just Baby Town frolics."
24718,success,Archer,"Okay, operations account."
24719,success,Archer,Just how deep in the red am I?
24720,success,Archer,Out of my mind.
24721,success,Archer,"Oh, no."
24722,success,Archer,How?
24723,success,Archer,How did I spend that much money?
24724,success,Archer,"Yeah, I know it's sexy, Woodhouse."
24725,success,Archer,That's why I bought 10.
24726,success,Archer,Now arrange those by color.
24727,success,Archer,These are all black.
24728,success,Archer,"Oh, are they?"
24729,success,Archer,Or are five in a dark black and five in a slightly darker black?
24730,success,Archer,And now I'm short a slightly darker black one.
24731,success,Archer,"So let's just put all my expenses into some pathetic idiot's account by the name of Oh, Krenshaw."
24732,success,Archer,- Oh.
24733,success,Archer,Now that's not very nice.
24734,success,Archer,"- Oh, God."
24735,success,Archer,"Hey, I was I was just talking about you."
24736,success,Archer,And about how this isn't what it looks like.
24737,success,Archer,- A lot of that going around.
24738,success,Archer,- Yeah.
24739,success,Archer,It's an epidemic.
24740,success,Archer,"For example, my real name is Kremenski."
24741,success,Archer,- Is that sound?
24742,success,Archer,Is that Jewish?
24743,success,Archer,- It's Russian.
24744,success,Archer,Um - Russian-Jewish?
24745,success,Archer,"- I'm the mole, idiot."
24746,success,Archer,What?
24747,success,Archer,I made up the mole.
24748,success,Archer,"Yes, but you told Pam and now everyone is looking for a real mole."
24749,success,Archer,"God, do we hate Pam."
24750,success,Archer,- So I have to escape.
24751,success,Archer,- And irony.
24752,success,Archer,Thanks for breaking into the mainframe for me.
24753,success,Archer,- Double irony.
24754,success,Archer,"- I'll need 50,000 for travel expenses."
24755,success,Archer,- Fifty thousand?
24756,success,Archer,- From your account.
24757,success,Archer,- That's too much.
24758,success,Archer,- It's all last-minute bookings for two.
24759,success,Archer,Wha?
24760,success,Archer,Oh.
24761,success,Archer,"Because when I hand the notorious Duchess to the KGB I won't just get a promotion, I'll get my own dacha."
24762,success,Archer,- Too bad you'll never see it.
24763,success,Archer,- What the?

26837,success,Friends,and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
26838,success,Friends,When all of a sudden Sweet 'N Low?
26839,success,Friends,I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.
26840,success,Friends,"I got freaked out, and it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head."
26841,success,Friends,"I always knew he looked familiar, but."
26842,success,Friends,.
26843,success,Friends,"I had to get out of there, and I started wondering."

26845,success,Friends,"""Why am I doing this,"" and ""Who am I doing it for""?"
26846,success,Friends,"I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart."
