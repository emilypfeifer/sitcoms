0,How to Be a Gentleman,"I am one of the last of my kind.
Those who came before me, ruled the world.
Everyday, I carry on their proud legacy.
I open the door for a lady, but I am not a doorman.
I protect fellow citizens but I am not a policeman.
I put out cigarettes but I am not a cigarette putter-outer man.
I am a gentleman.
Oop.
That was close.
Jerry, hey.
Never miss.
Andrew, I've got some good news.
The magazin's been sold.
When a gentleman receives bad news, he is never at a loss for words.
What? Yep.
New owners are changing the entire format.
No more urbane and upscale.
We're going young and sexy; be women in thongs, articles about abs.
Yep, they want to expand the readership by targeting people who don't read.
This is insane.
How are you taking this so well? Simple.
I'm faking it.
Look, this is unacceptable.
You're the editor.
We should both walk in there right now and tell them we are not changing a thing.
I was thinking about doing that, I'm 50.
So I decided that I'm actually very, very excited about the new direction.
As is Cody.
Who is Cody? Cody is my new boss.
Who, by the way, is the same age as my son.
churn out mindless drivel for the lowest common denominator? That'd be great.
You're catching on to this much faster than I thought you would.
Your ""How to be a Gentleman"" is just too tame.
So, Cody would like a sexier angle.
I can't believe this.
I feel like my whole world is falling apart.
Oh, that's cause it is.
Happy birthday, honey.
Oh, isn't it great, spending your birthday with your family? Yes, Mom, it is perfect.
Perfect situation to wear a vest, hmm? Ah I read your column, Andrew.
I wanted to wear a vest, but my wife pooh-poohed the idea.
I'm sorry.
I still want to be attracted to you.
Call me crazy.
You really want to be like my brother? Look at him.
He's spending his birthday with us because he has no friends.
I'll be your friend, Andrew.
We could be ""vest friends.
"" Honey, you're doing it again.
What's that? Talking.
Oh, I love hearing you say words, Mike.
Oh, remember the time you said chimichanga? We laughed! Look, I love you, but you're fussy, you talk weird and you dress like a ship captain.
Oh.
Is this my birthday present from you? 'Cause you gave me a huge basket of bitchiness last year, too.
Well, I'm just looking out for you, like I always have.
Oh, like when I was in third grade and you walked into my homeroom on the first day of school and said, ""Don't beat up my little brother.
He's very weak and has no peripheral vision.
"" He gets that from me.
I literally can't see this.
See that? I can.
But nothing.
Look, doofus, you're so smart and good and kind, but the world doesn't know that because they can't see past your brass buttons.
My uncle had a brass eyeball.
Kept it under a patch, so it was all, it's all legit.
Peek-a-boo was quite traumatic.
Ah! What is it? Dude, you drive people away.
That's why Lauren dumped you.
Lauren did not dump me.
I released her at her request.
Her loss, our gain, Andrew.
Plus, I'm sure there's a nice girl out there that would love to date a lonely ship captain.
I think it's time for birthday presents.
Yeah, birthday presents.
Thank you.
This is from me and Mike.
It's a gift certificate for a training session at a gym.
Well, that was fun.
A gentleman always uses a gift, even if he doesn't like it or the musty place he has to go to redeem it.
Hi.
I have a gift certificate for a training session Excuse me-- Andrew Carlson? Yeah.
Dead arm! Bert Lansing From high school! Huh? Me and my buddies used to dead arm you all the time.
You don't remember me? I remember getting hit, but I don't remember by whom.
Whom? That's great, bro.
That makes me want to dead arm you again.
I was state wrestling champ? Uh I got expelled my senior year? For credit card fraud? That's the one.
That was never proven, by the way.
Nice seeing you again, Bert.
I'd shake your hand, but I can't quite lift my arm.
Sure, that's the dead armt work.
Man, I couldn't stand you in high school.
You were the worst.
I'm sorry? Always complaining that the dress code wasn't strict enough.
You tried to get rid of jeans, dude.
That would've killed me.
I only had two pairs of pants back then.
My jeans and my church jeans.
Well, it was good seeing you again, Bert.
I have a private training session, so I should probably go find my trainer.
Look no further, my friend.
This is my gym.
Bert's Body Shop.
I took the place over from my old man when he got sick.
Cancer of the penis.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
That's I'm messing with you, dude.
His penis is fine.
He's retired, but he still volunteers seven days a week being a pain in my ass.
All right, let's grab your credit card info so we can get you signed up for a membership pronto.
The sooner we do that, the sooner we can get you an adult male body.
As much as I'm enjoying you and these odors, I'm gonna go now, Bert.
So, good-bye.
Wait-wait-wait-wait- wait-wait.
I know this just looks like a regular gym, but it's way more than that.
See, I got a whole philosophy, bro.
I'm into the whole Asian thing of mind, body and spirit.
Also tanning.
The trainer just ended up being this creep from high school who beat me up all the time.
Who? Johnny? No.
Steven? No.
Asian Steven? Is it a bird, Andrew? Is it a plane? No, it's Superman! Get out, Mike.
Well, I better go.
Bit gusty today.
Waah! - Bye.
- Bye.
He's super desperate for attention because I'm going out with Craig from work tonight.
Oh, Janet, come on.
You gotta stop spending time with this Craig guy.
It's just two friends who like to get together and gossip about their co-workers.
Janet? Janet? I didn't know we had an escalator installed.
Going down.
Why would superman need an escalator? I gotta go.
Okay.
Love you.
Bye.
Andrew.
Hey, Jerry! Cody's been breathing down my neck about your column.
I gotta give him something.
So pitch me your sexy new direction.
No.
I will not change my column, all right? It goes against my principles.
I've got to put my foot down.
Then I'll have to fire you.
What time is it due? There you go.
Remember, we're going after that demographic Holy Grail: men in their mid-to-late 30s who act like they're 15.
But I don't know anyone like Okay, never mind.
This is great, man! getting together, reconnecting like adults.
I was thinking more of a restaurant, not a strip club.
How are you? So, what have you been up to since high school? After senior year, you just disappeared.
Where'd you go? I graduated.
I went to college.
Nice.
Yeah, I always wanted to go to college.
Long story short, I got hit by an airport bus which gave me the money to buy my dad's gym, which was great 'cause I love helping people.
That's great, you can help me.
Tell me, what does a person like you like to read? Sports scores.
Perfect.
Nice.
Let's toss these shots back.
Oh, no, thank you.
I try not to drink at 10:30 in the morning on a Wednesday.
It's Friday somewhere.
No, it's not.
Come on.
It's on me.
It's rude for a gentleman to turn down a drink, right? Okay, I'll have a shot.
Just one.
Cheers.
No one cares about being a gentleman anymore, you know? You send an invitation that says ""evening wear.
"" Nobody wears evening wear.
I was at a wedding, guy showed up in a Hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts.
I mean, it was on a beach, but still white linen was called for.
How are you so drunk off two shots? I only had a grapefruit half for breakfast.
You know what? You're the kind of guy who shows up in shorts.
I mean, it's people like you are the reason Yeah, it's people I golike you are the reason that I don't have any friends.
And people like you are the reason I'm carrying around my ex-fiancÃ©e's sock like it's a friggin' sock.
Dude, first of all, you got to throw some protein in there with that citrus.
Secondly, I'm not taking the rap for that sock.
No, it's just, Lauren dumped me for a guy like you.
You know, with the muscles and the machismo, you know, who doesn't know the difference between a pinot blanc and a pinot noir.
Actually, that's not a good example 'cause that guy owns a winery.
Man, you're messed up bad.
You know everything about being a gentleman, but nothing about being a man.
What are you talking about? You see, life is a big jerk: It punches you in the face over and over again.
You gotta fight back or it'll knock you out.
Uh-oh.
Here it comes.
Wait a sec.
Are you gonna throw up on me? No, no, no, no I'm getting an idea.
You should be my client, dude! You see, I deal with the entirety of the totality of all that you are completely.
Check this out.
You know what this is? It's a big black circle.
No, it's a yin-yang without the yin.
It's a yang-yang.
It means that everything is of equal importance.
It's covering up an ex-girlfriend's name, isn't it? Well, yeah, but it's also my training philosophy.
You see, the mind and the body are the same.
When I look at you, your body I get sad.
Look at that guy.
He's uptight.
He's lonely.
And the last time he was intimate was with a sock.
I just carry around the sock.
I'm not having sex with it.
Well, maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
I am not having sex with a sock! Okay, okay.
Calm down.
My point is, well, I was a jerk to you in high school, but the universe is giving me a chance to make amends.
I know I can help you.
Hell, I already got you a new friend.
You did? Who? Me.
So what do you say? You want to be the yang to my yang? I can't believe I'm saying this, but yang.
I mean yes.
Let's get this guy a lap dance.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Well, the brunette has a kind face.
This is step one of my multi-step process.
You need to bury the past by having a funeral for your old relationship.
You need to burn that sock.
I don't want to burn the sock.
Hey.
For God's sake, that is my milk.
At least use a glass.
What? There's just a little bit left.
No, there isn't.
Oh, really? See, I told you.
Let's burn that sock.
Lighter.
Should I say something? I think that would be nice.
Well, I I've carried this sock around much like I've carried the memory of Lauren around.
Cat's in the cradle And the silver spoon - Little Boy Blue - What is that? What are you doing? Dude, it's a funeral.
When you coming home, son? I don't know when But we'll get together then I mean Don't.
You know we'll have a good time then Okay.
Okay, I'm burning this sock.
Oh.
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, it's lighting.
Okay.
I got it.
I got it.
Uh, put it in the sink.
I got it.
I got it.
The sink! I got it.
Bert, that trash can is wicker! What the hell is wicker? Aah! Move.
I got a blanket.
That's not a blanket; that's my blazer.
You guys okay? Oh.
Uh, yes.
Thank you, Lydia.
Just a little $19 trash can fire put out by a $500 blazer.
Don't worry, ma'am.
The area is safe.
I always feel safe around Andre I kill many of her bugs.
You should be taking off many of her pants.
You need to ask her out.
I can't ask her out.
She's my neighbor.
That's totally inappropriate.
I'm just not comfortable with that.
I hear you.
I get it.
I totally get it.
Thank you.
- What is that? What are you doing? - Step two.
Making you do something you're not comfortable with.
Bert? No! Bert! Bert! Hey.
Hey.
How are you? I'm great.
Good to hear you.
That is is good to hear.
So what's up? Really, really good.
I can't believe she said yes.
I can't believe it, either.
I was watching through the peephole.
That was the most awkward interaction I've ever seen.
But you nailed it.
That was tAnd tonight,ard inyou're going to nailn.
Oh, please.
She's a lady.
A lady you're going to nail.
So, Lydia, what do you do for a living? I do what I've always dreamed of doing.
I market cigarettes for a major tobacco company.
Well, that that sounds like an interesting job.
Thanks.
It is.
Besides, it's not like you market to children.
No.
We don't market to children.
Wink.
I can't actually wink, so I just say ""wink.
"" Lydia.
Oh.
Hello, Donny.
Who's the suit? Hi.
I'm Andrew.
And, uh, my suit's name is Glen.
I don't get that.
That's just a joke.
You a comedian? No.
Why are you standing? It's what you do when you meet a friend's acquaintance.
Acquaintance.
Right.
I don't want to interrupt.
FYI, your body looks bangin' tonight.
Whatever.
Is that a friend of yours? Oh, that's just my ex-boyfriend.
This is his restaurant.
You brought me to your ex's restaurant? I mean I mean, what if he does something to my food? Why would he do anything to you? You're not the one who cheated on him.
Think that makes sense.
Lydia, would you excuse me for one second? Oh, sure.
It's unbelievable.
Hey.
Hope I'm not, uh, interrupting.
Andrew.
What are you doing here? And your jacket's unbuttoned.
Are you okay? May I speak to you in private, please? You can speak to me right here.
What are you doing? You have a husband who loves you.
He's probably sitting at home right now, heartbroken.
No, he's not.
He's fine with it.
He's right over there.
What? Mike? Oh, hello, Andrew.
Mike.
Andrew.
Oh, unbuttoned.
You okay? What are you doing here? Oh, I'm just sitting at the bar, enjoying a bit of sherry and some udon noodles.
No, I mean your wife is over there having dinner with another man.
Doesn't that bother you? Well, I suppose I do have a bit of a green-eyed monster raging inside me.
Deep down, of course.
You can't let her get away with this, Mike.
Tell her how you feel.
Wouldn't want to poke the sleeping bear, Andrew.
She doesn't want to come home after a hard day's work and deal with my theatrics.
Her words.
Maybe that's exactly what she wants.
Maybe this is all about trying to get a rise out of you.
Look, Mike, life is a big bully, and it punches you in the face over and over again unless you punch back.
You're right.
I should be more aggressive.
No, I'm not feeling it.
Come on.
You All right.
Like that man over there.
Look, he's practically having sex with that lady.
Seriously? Hello.
So you two are having a bit of a rapprochement.
Andrew I am so sorry, but I still have feelings for Donny.
He's like a big cigarette.
I just can't quit.
Hey.
Tell you what, little man.
How about I go ahead and comp these spring rolls for you? Sometimes a gentleman must shake the hand of his rival.
Comp this.
But sometimes a bitch slap just works better.
""But sometimes a bitch slap just works better.
"" I love this.
It's young.
It's macho.
It is exactly what they want.
What'd you do to your hair? I just touched up the gray a bit.
Too much? Well, you you kind of look like Ben Affleck? A gentleman never tells another man that he doesn't look like Ben Affleck.
Sure.
Hey, Bert.
This is for you.
""For Bert.
Thanks for your fried nips.
"" Friendship.
The word is ""friendship.
"" That makes more sense.
You got the handwriting of a pirate.
It's calligraphy.
What's this? That is my credit card info.
I, uh I'd like to become an official member of Bert's Body Shop.
Maybe find out what step three is? You know, when I first took this place over, my old man said I'd probably screw it up, like everything else.
This right here this says I'm not a screwup.
It says that a smart guy like you trusts me.
It says, ""Screw you, Pops! ""Look at me now, you son of a bitch.
I'm somebody.
"" Thanks, Andrew.
Thanks for helping me rub it in the old man's face.
That's what fried nips is all about.
Ready to feel the burn, Bert.
Oh, hello, Andrew.
Mike, what are you doing here? I'm a member here now.
I like what Bert's done for you.
It's already rubbed off on me.
I gave that Craig a bitch slap.
And I stood up to Janet.
Had quite a night.
Two positions and a kiss.
Thanks for the new client, dude.
Everything he says, I want to hug him.
Ah, well, look at that.
I guess, uh, I helped you, too.
Actually, there are a few other ways I think I can help.
You see, proper gym etiquette mandates that you need to Dead arm! What was that? You were being you.
We'll fix that.
Come on.",fail
1,Accidentally on Purpose,"Oh, I can't do another office party.
I've already slept with everyone here.
Oh Yup.
Olivia, focus.
James is coming soon.
Does this pose say, ""I'm over you, but I'll take you back""? No.
You just need to perk up your nipples.
This is painful.
Fine.
I'll do it.
Oh Look, I am on a mission.
When James sees me, I want him to realize he made a horrible mistake in Paris.
Okay, just a few more steps.
And - voila! - Oh, my God.
Heights.
Oh, beautiful heights.
Romantic heights.
Oh, my God, it's the Eiffel Tower! Oui! Je t'aime! Oh, my God, it's a bag! It's our three-year anniversary, so I do.
You do what? I do really want to open the bag.
It's candy.
So, do I bite into it and find something else? Yeah.
A pecan.
It's marzipan in the shape of a camera because you're a film critic.
The best one at my newspaper.
What did you think it was going to be? Ja, ja.
Ich liebe dich.
That.
That? No.
You know I don't do that.
Look, when we started dating, I told you I never wanted to get married again, and you said, ""Oh, my God, do you own this plane?"" Lots of people say they're never going to do things, and then they do them.
Like in Gone with the Wind.
Scarlett O'Hara says she'll never go hungry again, but then she does.
But we're not gonna go hungry tonight, because we have reservations at Le Crillon, he said, changing the subject.
I don't think I can change the subject.
I want a partner.
I want someone who actually stays for breakfast.
I want someone who's there no matter what.
I want to grow up.
Fantastic sex in exotic locales was fine when I was 35, but I'm 36 now.
Thirty-seven.
Good-bye.
Yeah, I love marzipan.
Focus on the mission, 'cause this is where I turn it all around.
Okay? He's gonna walk in here, take one look at this, take one look at this, realize he lost the best thing that's ever happened to him, maybe even cry a little, and beg me to come back.
- I don't think so.
- Why not? He's in the doorway with Kate Moss.
Ah! Abort mission! Abort mission! # I can't be anything without you.
# I wonder if he'll marry Kate Moss.
Abby, how come you never wonder what good things could happen to me? 'Cause I'm your sister.
I just think you should forget the handsome gajillionaires who also happen to be your boss.
I mean, look how happy I am since I married Nick.
And you know why? Because he is stable, well-balanced, supportive.
Yes.
Nick would make a good chair.
Excuse me.
He would make a great chair.
Oh, listen, look around.
You'll find somebody else.
I get proposed to all the time.
I may be married now.
I'm not entirely sure.
But I do know that I cannot go back to Dubai.
Yeah, that's you, Olivia.
I watch movies for a living, so to me, the three stages of womanhood are: Meg Ryan in Sleepless in Seattle, Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail, and Meg Ryan in the grocery store, saying, ""No, really, I am Meg Ryan.
"" Hey, excuse me.
Can you help settle a bet between me and my buds? Well, that's kind of my mission in life.
If you could be stranded on a desert island with one of us, which one would it be? Oh, well, that depends.
I mean, how can each of you enhance my desert island experience? Do you have any special skills? Can you make a radio out of a coconut? No, but I can take coconut shells, wear 'em like a fake bra, and dance around like a little girl.
Anybody can do that.
He's right.
You're out.
Come on! Okay, which one of you two looks better with your shirt off? Wow.
I love this game! And after we've been running around naked all day, we'll be hungry, and I can cook.
I'm a chef.
You had me at ""naked.
"" Come on, dude, let's try it out on that girl who keeps reaching for her drink and missing.
Yes.
Dibs.
Dibs.
I'm Zack.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Oh.
I'm Billie.
You don't have to do that.
Mojito, please.
Perfect.
You know, I bet my buds I could go a whole day eating and drinking only things that end in ""tos.
"" Mojitos, burritos, taquitos.
I did that once, but with things that end in ""oni.
"" Pepperoni, spumoni, calzone.
But there wasn't a bet involved.
My sorority was just full of bulimics.
- You're funny.
- Thank you.
- And pretty.
- Okay! # All the single ladies, all the single ladies # Hey, you're a really great dancer.
Uh-huh.
Just another thing I'd bring to your desert island experience.
- You're funny.
- Yeah.
But I'm running out of charming.
I think I have some more back at my apartment.
And some homemade ravioli.
What do you say? Abso-maybe.
Give me a minute.
Okay.
Quicker! Quicker! Quicker! Oh, screw it.
Guys, a golden opportunity has just presented itself.
I'm drunk! Look, I know this may sound nuts, but I'm thinking of going home with a guy who may be significantly younger than me, and I just need to know if the situation is empowering or desperate.
- Is he over 18? - Yeah.
Empowering.
# If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it # # Oh, oh, oh # So, to conclude our tour of the ""bropartment,"" this is the spot where we eat.
Mm-hmm.
And, uh, that's the spot where we play Grand Theft Auto.
I killed three hookers and robbed a bank this afternoon.
It was very exciting.
And that's just a spot on the floor.
I call him Steve.
You weren't kidding about having some charming back at the apartment.
And you are a fantastic cook.
Well, I am the second assistant to a semi-important sous-chef.
Basically, I boil things.
But one day, I'm gonna have my own restaurant.
Well, I'm making reservations now, 'cause that was, like, the best thing I have ever eaten.
What's for dessert? Whoa! Okay.
I know I set you up with that dessert line - and you were right to jump on that - Yeah.
but, um, I'm just not a one-night stand kind of person.
I just never do things like this.
Yeah, but lots of people say they'll never do things, and then they do them.
Ooh.
- So, this is the spot where we - Yup.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Look, that hooker's still moving.
Oh! What was it like? Like eating candy.
I love candy.
What kind of candy? Young candy.
Ah.
I'm not kidding.
He smelled like a Skittle.
Ladies, I feel like I tasted the rainbow.
Oh.
The whole experience made me feel great about myself.
My pores even look smaller.
Look.
Oh, fantastic.
I'm sure I'll never see him again, but so what? I'm really glad you called me.
Yeah, yeah.
Me, too.
Take off your top.
This is endless! How much time is left? Was I supposed to be timing it? I was taking a picture of the back of my head in the mirror.
Please, pay attention.
This is the most important moment of my life.
Oh! Your first pregnancy test.
That's adorable.
Yay! No! Didn't you use condoms? I guess, it turns out, they're not 100% effective unless you actually take them out of your purse.
Billie, Billie, Billie, always use a condom.
And an alias.
Is it possible that you kind of got pregnant on purpose? I mean, maybe somewhere deep down inside, you wanted this.
You know what, Abby? This is just like when we were kids.
You always think you know what I'm thinking.
You always think you know exactly what I'm all about, but the truth is maybe you're right.
Yes! I always wanted to be an aunt! Aunt Abby! So, we're keeping it then? Well, I'm a journalist.
I ask the tough questions.
If I don't do it now, I may never get another chance.
Oh, my God, I'm going to have a baby.
- Oh.
- Hey.
So, how are you gonna tell the baby baby daddy? Can we please not call him that? Let's call him the father of my niece.
I want a girl.
But I finally had a boy toy.
And I only got to play with him for a couple weeks, and now my boy toy got me pregnant, and when I tell him, he's going to freak out.
I broke my boy toy.
I have got a ten-minute break.
So, what did you want to tell me? Zack, I'm pregnant.
Zack? Zack, are you okay? Mm-hmm, yeah.
No.
I was just all psyched 'cause I thought you came here to do it in the alley, but it turns out you're pregnant.
L- I don't know what to say.
You don't have to say anything.
You don't have to do anything.
I just needed you to know, in case, years from now, you need a kidney.
So you'd have options.
So I'm guessing this means we're done, so I'm gonna go, 'cause I just saw a rat.
Rat.
Rat.
Rat.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
You can't just say something like that and then walk away.
I mean, this is this is kind of my baby, too, right? Couldn't have done it without you.
Well, then, I want to be involved.
Are you sure? Because I can do the rest without you.
I mean, it's such a big responsibility - and you're so young.
- Look, my dad walked out on me, and I used to think it was 'cause I'd done something wrong, you know? I can't stand to think there'd be some little kid out there wondering why his dad didn't love him.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I hate your dad.
We are not naming the baby after him.
I want to be there for you, okay? And him or her or them.
So, what do we do now, that special breathing? It's a little early for that.
Yeah, but it's making me feel better.
I mean, I guess if you want, you can come with me to my first doctor appointment.
I'll do better than that.
I'll drive you there.
You will? Yeah.
Oh, my God.
That is the sweetest, most perfect I love you.
- What? - What? So, do you drive a Rent-A-Van as some sort of a second job? I wish.
No, I was only crashing at Davis' until his brother got out of prison.
Well, when does he get out? - Yesterday.
- Can't wait to meet him.
Well, don't worry, I'll just sleep in the van.
You're gonna sleep in here? Well, not here.
Back there, you know.
It's nice.
Except when I park on a hill.
Well, lucky we live in San Francisco where there are no hills.
You look pretty in that paper gown.
Well, I feel pretty.
Cold, cold, coldy, cold, cold! You do this all day? This is like robot porn.
Yes, it is.
Okay, Billie, your chart here says you're thirty Bada-bada-bada, ba-ba-ba! seven.
You said you were 32.
That was when I thought I was never gonna see you again.
There's the heartbeat.
Oh, my God.
And that is your baby.
Wow.
It's beautiful.
- It looks just like you.
- I know! I think you should stay with me.
Temporarily.
Till a couch opens up.
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't want to complicate your life.
Why stop now? So, you're really gonna let Zack move in? You're supposed to taste the rainbow, not let it live in your office.
What was I supposed to do? Let the father of my child live in a van so he could be hacked up by some crazy drifter? He lives in a van! He is the crazy drifter! Dude, this place is sick.
What's that? - An armoire.
- Oh.
What's that? A cake plate.
What's that? A sconce.
Sconce.
Sweet.
Dude, I got to knock me up a cougar.
Hello, there.
I prefer the term ""lynx"" or ""ocelot.
"" Dude, she sounds like Shrek.
Where's the kitchen? Why can't Zack and Billie have a relationship? Look at Ashton and Demi.
Oh, no, no, this is not a relationship.
We're not having sex anymore.
Look, I'm a mother now.
I have to do what a mother would do, and my mother never would've slept with him.
Holy crap, you didn't tell mom.
Okay.
Zack and I spoke, and he agreed we just need to set boundaries.
Uh-oh.
Look, I like you a lot, but we talked about this.
Remember our whole boundaries conversation? Yeah, but when you said, ""Don't touch my stuff,"" I thought you meant, like, your soy milk and your computer.
No, I meant don't touch my stuff.
Okay, I got it.
Yay, boundaries.
I've made a horrible mistake.
Technically, you've made a series of horrible mistakes.
I feel this weird bond with Zack, which is probably just the hormones, but I have to think of my future, you know? I mean, I want a husband one day.
One with a checking account and a toothbrush he acquired via purchase rather than ""dibs.
"" I just can't believe how complicated everything got.
This? Oh-ho-ho! This isn't complicated.
What's going to be complicated is when you have to start telling people.
Telling people what? Oh, hello, boss.
No, I was just I was just What? Oh.
You look great.
Oh, I bet you say that to all the girls.
Oh, wait, you do.
No, really, you're-you're glowing.
Did you do something different? You have no idea.
Listen, I've I've thought about us a lot, and I think I'm ready.
Ready? Now you're ready? I want us to go to the next level.
Wh-What's the next level? We could live together.
What? Where? Sometimes at my place, sometimes at your place.
That's not living together.
It's not? I miss you.
You should miss me.
I'm fantastic.
There are other men who realize that.
Men who don't keep their emotions hidden like they're nuclear codes.
Available, mature men.
It's getting more complicated! It's getting more complicated! What are you doing here? I thought I'd bring you lunch.
I made you a spinach salad.
It's full of iron that'll be good for the - Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! for the baby.
What? Why doesn't anyone know what ""ba-ba-ba-ba-ba"" means? Baby? Yeah, she's having my baby.
Cool, huh? Who is this clown? - I'm Zack; I'm the father.
- What? I've got to update my Facebook status.
Wait a minute, wait, you're having this punk's baby? What is this, some desperate cry for help? Not desperate.
It's empowering! Hey, who do you think you're talking to? You're gonna talk to somebody, you talk to me.
Am I gonna have to call security? - Why, you can't handle me yourself, Grandpa? - Ooh, - this is fantastic, yes! - Oh You should know that I know Krav Maga.
Fine, call him I'll fight him, too! Zack, James, stop, stop! Stop, stop! What are you doing? There's no reason you should even care.
I know I've screwed up a lot with you, but I've always cared.
Are you gonna eat that salad? Hey, roomie, let me help you with that.
Hey, a surprise party.
Um, you met Davis and-and Ryan, and this is Shane.
He just got out of prison.
Not violent drug-related.
Oh Good.
Does he babysit? Say hi to Billie, guys.
- Billie! - Yes, the Niners are up by four! She doesn't look that old.
Is that not okay that they're here? - 'Cause they were just helping me - No, no, it's fine.
I just need to put these groceries away and maybe eat an entire sheet cake.
Don't go in there.
Are you freakin' kidding me?! What, do you walk around going, ""Hulk hungry!"" It was it was an accident.
But no worries, Shane thinks he can reattach it.
He learned lots of handyman skills in the joint.
Really? What is your problem? You, you, you! You pick me up in a bar, you call me again, you have some kind of crazy magic super sperm, you're, like, the worst one-night stand in the history - of time.
- Hey, right back at you, okay? I don't know how they did things in your day, but nowadays girls say stuff like, ""Hey, dude, I'm not on the pill.
"" In my day? This is still my day.
It's not even lunch in my day.
God, why did I let you move in? ""Let me"" move in? I don't need to be here.
I was fine on my own! Oh, yeah, you were thriving! Why don't you just move back to your old place? It's parked right outside.
Love to! Hey, Shawshank, if you want to fix that fridge I'm packing up your crap.
No, I'm packing up my own crap.
Oh, my God, a nursery.
We painted it lavender 'cause we didn't know what sex the baby is, and pink plus blue makes lavender.
Shane did the bears.
He's better at skulls, but we went with the bears.
I mean, do you like it? We can paint it any color you want.
It's wonderful.
So, I'll just get my stuff.
No, you can't.
I mean, please don't.
I really like what you bring to my apartment.
You want me to stay? Yeah.
I mean, you might want to keep the truck as a nice, little pied-à-terre, but sure.
Okay.
Where are you guys going? Never mind that blowup.
Just hormones.
It's all good.
Were you using my grandmother's urn as a water pipe? I just want to say I know this is weird, but I'm really glad I met you.
Me, too! Is the floor too hard? Nah.
This is kind of romantic.
I'm not sleeping with you.
Okay.
Hey, so what do you want for breakfast? I can make, uh, eggs Florentine, chocolate chip waffles, fruit smoothies I love you.
- What? - What?",fail
2,Imaginary Mary,"1 Mary: This is Alice from way back.
Just a kid doing her best to ignore the implosion of her parents' marriage.
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath Which is why she dreamed me up in her twisted, lonely little mind.
Agreed politely I guess that I forgot - What's up? - Who are you? I'm Mary, dummy.
And I'm here because I love you.
With my help, you're gonna kick life in the A-double-S! [Chuckles.]
That's a swear word.
I'll teach you a bunch.
- See Mommy? All sad and broken.
- [Crying.]
That will never be you, understand? Go on, say it out loud.
Say it.
[Whispering.]
That will never be me.
You're gonna be fierce and independent, and you will never rely on any boy.
Or girl.
Your haircut makes things confusing.
- Got it.
- Now, let's go smash something your daddy loves.
Even though Alice's parents were never there for her, I always was.
I'm glad your mom bailed again 'cause that means we can take the bus downtown to get our noses pierced.
Well, your nose.
I don't have one.
Didn't skimp on the butt, though.
Thanks for that.
Yep, I was turning that shy little girl into a kick-ass woman, which meant, over time, she needed me less and less.
It's happening.
Our first time.
Hey, don't be so boring! Flip the script and get on top! What the? No! No, no, no! 10 more minutes! No! No, no! You still need me! At least let me get a peek at his diiii I got the eye of the tiger Turns out, I had no reason to worry.
Thanks to me, Alice now owns her own business, travels the world, and is single like a fox.
That is, until this guy came in for a meeting.
And in 2015, I won a National Magazine Award - for my - Online dating profile.
- Kudos.
- Wha - [Computer beeping.]
- Clicking out.
Um ""DivorcedRadDad""? Really? That'sour user ID? - [Keyboard clacking.]
- And we're frozen.
And pulling out the cord.
- And plenty of battery left.
- And we're done.
- We'll be in touch.
- Will you, though? No.
- [Telephone rings.]
- Know what? Since this is the worst interview in history, can we just go for broke? My dating profile's a mess.
You're a PR guru.
Can you fix this? Since it's everything a woman isn't looking for, let's dig in.
First, please, lose the Crocs and the braided belt.
Ben: That's casual Ben.
I'm casual.
You're cute.
Push the cute.
No Crocs, thinks I'm cute.
Got it.
Hey, what do you say we continue this work sesh over dinner? You do know I was out the moment I saw you had a kid, right? Then you're really out 'cause I have frickin' three, so let's just keep it professional.
If all goes well, you're gonna help me fall in love.
Sure, there was something very charming about DivorcedRadDad's complete lack of game.
But my girl knew how to hit it and quit it.
[Chuckles.]
I gave it three days.
I was wrong.
[Telephone rings, answering machine beeps.]
Andy: Dad? Pick up.
It's an emergency.
[Telephone beeps.]
Andy? What's up? There is a poll on our class Facebook page, ""Most likely to grow up and be an accountant.
"" I am leading.
- And it's a friggin' landslide! - I voted three times.
Daddy, I lost a tooth at Grandma's! Okay, guys, none of this is an emergency.
But I didn't get any money under my pillow, which means the tooth fairy is dead.
Or she's just a very busy fairy.
Okay, when are you gonna be here? Five seconds.
[Telephone beeps, clatters.]
- Put your pants on! - What's happening? - My kids are home.
- Who? - My children.
- Oh! Pants.
Pants.
Whoa! - Pants.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Okay.
Okay.
- Yeah, we're on the second floor.
- Babe, you can do this.
You hang down, stick the landing.
We're really geed a new system to avoid your kids.
Yeah.
Or you meet 'em.
At worst, I'd break an ankle.
Okay, listen, the truth is I want you to meet them.
I want us to take the next step 'cause you are absolutely amazing, and I love you.
You got a halfy.
The emotional stuff gets me excited sometimes.
Oh, God, you're cute.
- Let's go for it! - Shut up.
- Huh? What? - Really? I mean, obviously, I have to talk to the kids, - make sure that they're down with it.
- Exactly, because they may not be, - even though I totally and completely am.
- [Door opens in distance.]
- Andy: Dad? - Dora: We're home! - Bunny: Why do we bury people? - [Door slams.]
I'm out.
Let me know how it goes.
Just like that, everything I taught her literally flew out the window.
Meeting his kids can only lead to heartbreak.
- Yeah! - And I cannot let that happen.
- Nailed it.
- Stuck it! Lucky for Alice, help is on the way.
Gather up.
Family pow wow time.
- I've got a big - Andy: I had the worst day.
I need attention now! Okay, where is this on the urgency scale, pal? Anything below a seven, you handle on your own.
This accountant thing? It's sticking.
Okay, that's a hard four, tops.
Kids, the scale only works - when we're honest with the numbers.
- All day, it was, ""There goes the accountant!"" and ""Do my taxes, Holmes!"" See, this is your whole problem.
Y-You need to be more like my boyfriend complicated, powerful, a rogue Jedi.
- Kylo Ren is not your boyfriend.
- Yet.
- [Andy and Dora yelling.]
- Guys? Guys? Guys! I'm dating a lady! Her name is Alice, and I'd love for you to meet her.
Okay, I can tell this is a lot, right? But you're really gonna like her.
She's a PR rep for sports stars, and she's cool and funny and sexy.
Which is not something you tell your children.
The point is, your dad is kind of nervous, okay? Does she have kids? No.
That's just it, Peanut.
She hasn't had all her coolness drained out of her the way you guys have done to me.
Boop! Uh, sorry, let me get this straight.
You're dating a woman whose whole job is to make someone look better than they actually are? Oh, this is perfect for me.
You can tell Alice no, tell A-dogg I'm in.
Kind of weird to already give her a nickname, but that's a yes.
- Who else? - Fine.
Not said with a lot of enthusiasm, but still a yes.
This is happening! - So this is happening.
- Totally happening.
Okay, let's do a rundown on the kids.
First, Andy he's the oldest.
He is very excited to meet you and will come on too strong, so we need some kind of a signal - in case he, like, corners you.
- Corners me? As for Dora, she's the classic middle child, Also, a big-time fangirl, so don't fake your way through a Harry Potter convo.
You will lose.
Then there's Bunny the little one.
Likes to ask a lot of philosophical questions about death.
Do not engage.
Table-side guac coming your way, seÃ±or.
iHola! Don't go loco on me, girl.
Mary's back to help.
[Gurgles, sniffs.]
What the Holy I know, how cool is this, right? They make it right at the table.
Kids? Huge step.
You're spinning out bad.
That's why you dug me out of your brain.
But don't worry.
We'll handle it together! This isn't happening.
- It's just an appetizer.
Are you okay? - He's onto you.
Pick up your phone like you have a work emergency! Work emergency.
Some public-relations guys need my help with some PR stuff.
I got to go.
Love you.
Bye.
Hasta luego, beardy.
Wait.
You're running from me? Okay, now you're just being rude.
No hug.
No kiss.
This is not how I raised you.
You're just in my head.
Go away.
Slow down! I can't keep up! Do not make me gorilla this.
Why'd you have to give me these damn stumpy legs? I cannot hear things that don't exist.
La la la la la la la [Out-of-tune guitar strumming.]
[Sighs.]
You are real.
Technically, imaginary, but to you, I'm real as hell and here to stay.
[Laughs.]
Look at us.
The besties are back.
My bestie is back.
Oh, my God.
You're back.
Which brings me to why I am here.
Ben.
He is so cute and kind, - and you have to run.
- What? Why? Look, Ben is a dad.
[Grunts.]
That means, if you're with him [Grunting.]
you're a mom.
And before you know it, you're gonna be at a wedding, and the ""Macarena"" is gonna blast, and you're gonna mom-dance, just like this.
I am a mom, and I do the Macarena Where is my minivan? Oh, I'll find it later Okay, I will never dance like that, but I am freaking out.
Let's get down and dirty.
Go.
It's, like, I don't know how to mom.
Don't know if I want to mom.
Don't know if a real mom would use ""mom"" as a verb.
We're in agreement.
You know nothing.
But I really love this guy.
I don't want to lose him.
Okay, my Mary advice you meet the kids, just not right now.
Listening.
Take two, three months to study up on these ""children people.
"" Learn all about them.
Could take a year, maybe more.
And the longer I put off meeting Ben's kids, the more I'm protecting our relationship.
Exactly.
You're blowing him off 'cause you care so damn much! See? This is why you're here.
Lucky for you, I got a plan.
Ta-da.
Adele tickets? That must've cost a fortune.
Hottest ticket in town.
Great way to meet your kids, right? Um, the concert's six months from now.
But worth the wait.
Look at the row number.
One.
Look, I get it.
You're meeting my kids.
It's scary, especially for you.
- [Knocking on glass.]
- He's onto us! Kick him in the nuts and run! [Grunts.]
Me? Scared of kids? I don't even hide when people bring them in here anymore.
I mean, I close my door, but that's just because I have a bowl of candy, and it's kind of like it's my candy.
All that matters is I love you, and we're in this together.
I'm scared, and the tickets were a stall.
Traitor! And look, if you want to wait, we can wait.
Promise.
I will love you no matter what.
Unh-unh.
Unh-unh.
Unh-unh.
Mnh-mnh.
And we're done.
Thank you.
That was disgusting.
You know what? You already talked to the kids.
- Let's do this.
[Groans.]
- Thank God.
Canceling would've been hard to explain.
They are super suspicious and awful with change.
- They sound great.
- So what should we do? - [Gasps.]
Disney World.
- We could fly to Disney World.
It's a big swing more of a huge vacation than a first meet.
- Gun range.
- Gun range! - Gotcha.
- What? is something a crazy person would suggest.
I meant to say burgers? Perfect.
And maybe some mini-golf? - Sounds fun.
- Sounds awful.
- Ben: All right, I got to run.
- Okay.
We will swing by your place around 6:00, grab some chow, then hit the links.
Wait.
My place? What just happened? This mom dance.
[Vocalizing ""Macarena"".]
- [Body thuds.]
- [Grunts.]
Hey, Macarena It's okay.
No need to panic.
I deal with pro athletes.
They're huge babies.
A few kids? I've got this.
- You so got this! - Okay, I do not.
I am panicking.
Come on.
Do what you do.
Coddle me.
Make me feel good.
Give me advice.
Go.
- [Doorbell rings.]
- [Whimpers.]
Kids like ice cream.
Sorry.
That's all I got.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh.
Okay.
So, uh, guys, this is Alice.
This is Dora and Bunny.
Nice to meet you.
Damn! Sweet pad you got here.
How much you lay down? Like, two, three hundo? Let's hang.
I'm Andy.
- That's my son.
- Mm-hmm.
Go.
Hey, need some advice.
So, there is this guy in my class that sells pot brownies.
Do you think being a spaced-out burner would change public perception of me? And keep in mind, I am struggling socially.
- I'm gonna say don't do drugs.
- Copy that.
Okay.
- Personal question.
- What was the last one? On my computer, I have this folder marked ""math homework,"" but it's just boobs.
- Where is your dad? - Now, give me the honest, objective, female perspective.
Am I normal? Yes.
[Slapping counter.]
Knew it! [Laughs.]
Man, it feels so good to rap with someone who gets me.
Now, about my folder marked ""Spanish"" - Ben: All right.
- Oh, thank God.
It's getting late.
We should probably order dinner, and also not serve ice cream.
We'll sidebar on this later, A-dogg.
[Clicks tongue.]
[Chuckling.]
""A-dogg.
"" - Nicknames.
That's kind of fast.
- Just roll with it.
He's the easy sale.
No, he's great.
He's fine.
He's very open, he bangs things.
Girls are my specialty because I was a girl.
I am a girl.
Like, I should probably just, like, focus on them.
I'd tread carefully.
Bunny's going through a death phase, and Dora I know I shouldn't say this, couldn't love her more, but if I had to rank them, she would be like - Dora: Hey, Dad.
- right here! Hey, Dora.
I had an idea.
I was thinking maybe next weekend, you and I Oh, I'm gonna stop you right there.
I don't do manis, pedis, shopping, or Gosling movies.
Oh, um, also, Andy just ruined your fancy rug.
He makes me smile.
Oh, my what the hell, Andy? Little spill.
Where's your shirt, dude? I panicked and used it as a rag, and no one look at my middle.
I am working on it.
Bunny: Daddy, look! I'm Elvis right before he died on the toilet.
Oh, careful.
That's a vintage Les Paul.
What does this thing do? - [Alice gasps.]
- [Wawa bar clatters.]
Andy: Oh, good.
That is way worse than what I did.
Please don't hate me.
- No.
- She paused.
- She hates me.
- Oh! Andy: Oh, God.
Someone just tweeted the Facebook poll.
They're calling me ""Blandy.
"" It's a combination of my name and the word bland.
Blandy.
Why do my peers always come up with insults that are so clever and smart? Why? Bud, I know this whole thing sucks right Okay, that's a lady's jacket.
Ugh! Alice, I need you.
Did he just ask for me? Mm-hmm.
He's really taken to you.
You okay? I'm just so tired of everyone looking at me like a nobody.
If you don't like how people see you, just make them see something else.
What do you mean? She means change everything.
Reinvent yourself a little.
Extensive plastic surgery.
Get a new hairstyle.
Be anyone but you.
Maybe run for class office.
So, start over as a person? That's your advice? [Grunts.]
See? He gets it.
- We're good.
- No.
[Chuckles.]
You are having a PR crisis.
- Give me your phone.
- Uh, no, I don't Trust me.
This is my business.
All you got to do is Boom.
And problem solved.
[Cellphone vibrates.]
Someone just retweeted me.
[Cellphone vibrates.]
And again.
What did you say? ""Blandy in the house, y'all.
"" Wait.
What? - [Cellphone vibrating.]
- ""Making life bland as balls.
#BlandyAsBalls! #Blessed!"" Oh, no, no, no, no.
W-Why would I say this about me? 'Cause you're taking the power away from them.
Oh, they are tweeting me back so fast.
And mean! Oh, my God! Okay, we can handle this.
Oh, my God.
They're awful.
Okay.
We'll just say that your phone was hacked, and then we'll check you into the hospital for exhaustion.
Wha I'm not Lamar Odom! I am a boy! Not in that jacket you ain't.
You just ruined my life in one minute.
Thanks a lot! Mary: Okay.
The way I see it, these are garbage children.
- It's not them, it's me.
- What happened? Want to know what just happened? I just broke Andy.
I broke your child.
I broke him good.
And he was the only one who even gave me a chance! Bunny turned on me for no reason.
It's perfectly natural to pause when somebody destroys your favorite thing.
And Dora? She's a nerd, dude.
And I like nerds, but she's a mean nerd.
Whoa.
Time out.
Okay.
You can't rip on my kids.
- Only I can do that.
- I can't do this.
I thought that I could, and I can't.
The way Andy just looked at me? I won't do to your kids what my parents did to me.
Alice, what are you You're not your parents.
I am.
[Sighs.]
I'm sorry.
W-What? Y-You want us to go? Is that what you want? [Scoffs.]
Okay.
[Sighs.]
I need a drink.
Alice, I know you're upset, but a drink won't fix anything.
Now, 10 drinks Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Hands up in the air And another! How's my twerk? Look at me.
Alice, look at me! Yeah, it's good! How's mine? And another! Do it! Don't go breaking my heart I couldn't if I tried Oh, honey, if I get restless Don't go breaking my heart Man: Off the stage, lady! - Say you got to give it to 'em - Whoo! - Get a little rude, bring it in hot - Whoo! Whoo-hoo! [Yells.]
[Crowd groans, music stops.]
[Cheers and applause.]
Whoo! Uh-oh.
Uh-oh! Keep it in your mouth like a lady! That's my girl! Whoo! - [Body thuds.]
- Uh-oh.
I'm gonna need a taco, and a queso chango, and an enchiloco! Oh, my God, I love street enchilocos! - [Tires screech, horn honks.]
- Hey! I'm walkin' here! Yeah, she's walking here! Both: We are living so hard right now! [Groans.]
Never drinking again.
Mary: Not even a nice glass of Chardonnay? 'Cause sometimes a lady has to let off steam.
What the why are you spooning me? I like snuggles, chica.
Why you got to make this weird now? Ohh.
What happened last night? Well, let's see, there was drinking and dancing and singing, and driving Ben away and the bull! [Laughs.]
You rode a bull! Oh, no.
Ben.
I ruined everything.
Ohh.
But isn't that why I'm here? 'Cause deep down, you knew this couldn't work? He had to go, right? No, I think deep down, I'm just scared.
No, no, no, no, p-please don't cry.
- [Sniffles.]
- Please? We can fix this! How? How do we fix this? I got it! Go to him.
Go to him.
Yes, that's what people do in situations like this! And you apologize.
And beg for forgiveness.
And kiss him long and hard, and let me watch.
Let's move.
Shoe.
I only have one shoe.
Shoe.
Shoe.
Here, shooey, shooey, shooey.
- Hello? - What [Exhales sharply.]
- You're here? - He's here? Ben: I wanted to make sure you got home okay.
You pocket dialed me and left a three-hour voice mail.
Really tore up the town after you ditched us, huh? We can explain.
- When Alice was 6 years ol - [Body thuds.]
Alice, you cut and run last night.
That's something I can't have, not for me, and especially not for my kids, you understand? [Voice breaking.]
I get it.
I blew it.
It's over.
What? Over? No.
This is a fight.
We're having a fight.
So it's not over? Oh, my God, you have no idea what you're doing at all, do you? [Laughs.]
I really don't.
Look, I know I messed up last night, but there's this voice in my head, and it really got to me.
- I know the voice, Al.
- Eh.
The fear, the doubt.
I have it, too.
Everyone does.
This one's really, really loud.
Well, there's another voice now mine and it is telling you that we can make this work.
You're way too good for me.
Okay, looks like we're back on track, so I'll just give you two your privacy.
Pretending to walk away and show time.
Well, it's coarse to the touch and doesn't match anything, but it won't stain 'cause it's made with chemicals.
Um, I wrote a note for you.
""Sorry I hurt your guitar.
Love, Bunny.
"" Bunny, there's no reason for you to be sorry.
I know it was an accident.
[Sighs.]
[Whispering.]
You misspelled some of the words to look extra cute, didn't you? Lot of bonding over here if either of you guys want to get in on this.
- I'll pass.
- I'm good.
Okay.
Look, if you're open to it, I would love a redo of our night out.
Both: Don't go breaking my heart How is this winning us over? So this is Alice today ruining our duet, but finally taking a chance on love.
What you want is never gonna happen.
Oh, yes, it's gonna happen Good thing I have her back 'cause she clearly has no idea what she's doing.
This doesn't mean I totally forgive you.
Gave you my heart Okay, maybe she's figuring it out a little bit - Together: Gave you my heart - but looking way uncool doing it.
Mary: Honey, you are mom-dancing.
Full-on mom-dancing! I won't go breaking your heart Oh, come on! You could still keep it sexy! - Don't go breaking my heart - You know, get a little of this.
And then, you know, one of these, then some shimmy shake, - and then the old Whoo! - [Thud.]
Andy: Alice, this girl retweeted me.
[Clears throat.]
""Love the way @AndyLovesTacos"" that's me is owning the nickname Blandy.
#TakingThePowerAway.
"" Wow.
Who's StonewashedJeans92? I don't know.
- [Clicks tongue.]
Thanks, A-dogg.
- Mm.
Hmm.
StonewashedJeans92.
Sounds like someone's old AOL screen name.
I threw a kid a bone.
[Cellphone vibrates.]
Oh.
Andy just sent StonewashedJeans92 a direct message.
""Hey, girl.
Thanks for the retweet.
Want to meet up IRL?"" Oh, boy.
Both: And account deleted.",fail

[speaking in Mandarin.]
When the FBI sent me here two years ago the Quantou were growing in strength.
Now you're crippling them financially.
[applauding.]
[speaking in Mandarin.]
Sorry.
Family squabble? [speaking in Mandarin.]
The usual.
You know he hates it when you use English, Kim.
That's why I'm doing it.
(Thomas) If she wanted a change of pace you could put her on that museum team.
[speaking in Mandarin.]
(Thomas) Your brother's assigning officers to escort a collection of terracotta soldier statues to Los Angeles for a museum tour.
[speaking in Mandarin.]
Who wants to go to Los Angeles? [instrumental music.]
Call me Mister Pitiful Baby, that's my name now Oh They call me Mister Pitiful Hey, what's going on, man? Como estas, man, how you been? Good talk, Carlos.
So where's the merchandise? I'm ready to do some shopping.
Here we go.
Here's the gun I told you about.
Woo, this is nice.
Is this from the future? Did you get this off a Storm Trooper? Bang! Aah! Scared your ass.
You were scared, you were scared.
Don't even act like you wasn't.
Let's talk money.
[siren blares.]
Easy, easy, I got this.
I got this, chill out.
What's goin' on, gentlemen? You know what, we're actually okay.
Y'all can go on 'bout your business.
Get on the ground.
[gunshots.]
Don't shoot, I'm a cop.
[gunshots continue.]
[instrumental music.]
Put it down, put it down, right now, get him.
Cuff him.
Carlos! Shut it down.
Shut it down and step outside.
Carlos, I'm not playing with you.
- What? - What, don't let me.
Shut it down before I put a bullet in your ass.
(Carlos) You shoot me, we both die.
Look down! Don't believe me, just watch Get some of this.
- Like that? - Shut up.
Now you like it.
That's the most fun I've had in years, I love it.
So, you think it's funny? You think it's real funny? You think it's a [screaming.]
Oh, man, my leg! Aa-a-ah! Uptown funk you up Uptown funk you up Adios, amigo! - Uptown funk you up - Come on Uptown funk you up [groans.]
[screaming.]
Oh! That's right.
Crazy weather we have.
It's rainin' black people.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
Keep that.
- No! - Okay.
So, how do you wanna do this? Would you like to go first? I realize that report looks bad I'll go first.
You crashed a helicopter into the home of an LA City councilman.
Captain, I had it under control until those patrol cops got in my way.
It's always someone else's fault, isn't it? Is that why you insist on working alone? Alright, Carter I honestly don't know how many times I have let you talk your way out of something like this.
I've definitely lost count myself.
I-I don't know how I could save you this time.
- Even if I wanted to.
- Captain, come on.
You're on a desk until further notice.
[instrumental music.]
[hip hop song playing.]
[door buzzes.]
[door whirring open.]
[music continues.]
[speaking in Mandarin.]
[sighs.]
Welcome to Los Angeles.
Have we arrived late? I was told we would load the trucks then call for police escort.
You're all Asian.
Chinese, actually! [gunshots.]
[music continues.]
[music continues.]
[telephone rings.]
[speaking in Mandarin.]
[song continues.]
[clattering.]
A ransom demand of 200 million US dollars was made for the return of the statues.
If the FBI does not make quick progress I will send you to Los Angeles to facilitate the payment.
[speaking in Mandarin.]
Seriously, you couldn't find a black GI Joe? This is a brown mark on a white guy.
Now, that's just lazy.
Hey, Didi! Did you see this? A bunch of gunmen killed six Chinese cops steal some old statues, put the dead cops back in the plane and torched the thing.
Carter, why are you reading the airport case file when you are not allowed to go anywhere near a case? - I like to read.
- Yeah, right.
Also, see those two, very, very white guys? I guarantee they're here about this.
And I bet they came to ask for my help.
Oh, Carter? A word.
No way.
If you like, you could watch me as I walk away.
- Huh? - I'll pass.
Admit it, you miss being my partner.
Carter, this is Agent Murray and Agent Weiss.
- They're here regarding - The airport heist.
I'm way ahead of you, already read the reports.
The crime took place on US soil so we're not obligated to include the Chinese in our investigation.
But as a courtesy, the bureau is allowing a detective from Hong Kong to consult.
We don't have time to look after a Chinese cop.
- But you do.
- Okay, I'm gonna stop you.
'Cause it almost sounds like you're asking me to babysit.
I hope you hate it.
Hey, man, I'm supposed to be meeting some Chinese cop from Hong Kong.
- I'm Carter.
- Carter? - Detective Carter.
- Carter.
Do you just love my name or do you not understand a word I'm saying? It's not right, that they stuck you with that clown.
Thanks, man.
Was talking to the Chinese guy.
I hate that guy.
Come on.
Come on.
(Carter) Can't believe I have to babysit some dude that doesn't speak English.
I got a plan, I'm gonna solve this case get back on Cole's good side.
Carter, you are gonna get your butt fired.
Hey, Lee, it's a good plan, right? He didn't answer, but I can tell he think it's a good plan.
Alright, I gotta make a stop.
Okay, you just wait in the car.
Hey, no, hey, just stay.
No, go-y! Thanks for listening.
[indistinct chattering.]
Check y'all out.
Guns on the table, drinking forties, just hanging out perpetuating negative stereotypes.
Let's not.
What the hell you want, Carter? - Let's go talk.
- I ain't goin' nowhere.
Or I could arrest you and all your friends for the drugs on the table and we could go talk down at the station.
Shit.
Come on.
[club music.]
Good for you.
Makin' a smart decision before I had to knock your ugly behind out in front of your friends.
- What's up, cuz? - What's up.
Hey! Look at you, man, looking like a hobby with a gun.
Uh, you looking like a black Ninja Turtle.
- Man, how grandma doing? - Oh, you know she good.
Oh, besides the thing on her foot.
I saw that, that's nasty.
Is that Did I feel a new gun? Did you? [gunshots.]
[grunts.]
Everyday [screams.]
[groans.]
[rock song playing.]
[laughs.]
[groans.]
[grunts.]
[glass shatters.]
[gunshot.]
Yeah.
- Yeah! - Ooh, nice.
This is unacceptable.
It's cool, I was just You speak English? Okay, relax.
Gerald is my cousin.
And that act we do is just so his people don't know we're connected.
How you doing? Nice to meet you.
- No.
- That was rude as hell.
Alright, and what are you doing? You're not even supposed to speak English.
I never said I don't speak English.
I let people talk who like to talk.
Makes it easier to find out how full of crap they are.
- Oh, burn! Ha ha.
- Shut up.
I was told a competent officer would assist me I assist no one, alright? And you're not even a part of this investigation.
I was sent here on behalf of the Chinese Government.
If the Feds wanted your help, why did they stick you with a cop from the LAPD? You give me your intel from the Chinese side and maybe I let you work with me.
- That sounds fair.
- I can do this alone.
Okay, you wanna work alone, yeah.
But I'm sure you'll be fine, I mean, you know the city pretty well, right? Yes, Gerald is a low-life criminal.
But he gives me information that helps me take down real criminals.
I do not like this.
Whoever did this is stone-cold.
Yes, this is a big job and they did it fast.
Perps got on to the runway by knocking out the security guard and locking him in his trunk.
At the hospital, the guard said they looked like legit LAPD officers.
Now, getting cop uniforms is easy.
It's tougher to get legit looking police cars.
But I know someone who once used a fake cop car shaking down drug dealers for cash.
I never heard of that story before.
Okay, I didn't wanna have to do this.
- Do what? - I'm telling grandma you skipped church last Sunday.
- Call her.
- I'm about to call her.
- I don't care.
- She number one on speed dial.
- Go ahead.
- Send! No, stop! I'll tell you.
Why you always gotta call grandma, man? Alright I know a few guys who do jobs like this.
Hey, Gerald, been a big help for real.
When I have the authority to do so.
I will come back and arrest you.
What? I don't like him.
He's mean.
Hey, you're supposed to say something nice.
What is wrong with you? Gerald always comes through.
Know that.
Yeah, this is a wonderful use of our time.
Was that sarcasm, Lee, doesn't suit you.
Looks like this is the place.
[flies buzzing.]
Professional hit.
One shot, back of the head.
Best way to keep someone from talking.
And without a forensic team to sweep this room it gets us nowhere.
I'm gonna teach you a little something about relationships in America.
Behind every man who's got himself in trouble there's a woman who cannot wait to say I knew it.
I tried to tell him.
Don't get mixed up with bad people.
Especially like that broke no-good son of a bitch Dicky! Do you have a last name on that broke no-good son of a bitch? Good rhythm really don't care I can take the elevator you can take the stairs Good rhythm killin' my time A little bit of luxury I really don't mind Is that Dicky Sterling.
Security guard who got beat up and thrown in the trunk.
Do I know you? - Yeah.
- Look, man.
I already told the Feds, I didn't see a thing.
Those guys beat the crap out of me.
Locked me in the trunk of my car.
Yeah, yeah, I know, it just seems a little weird that the security guard that got roughed up by bad guys in fake cop cars, has a buddy known to sell fake cop cars.
- You think that's weird, Lee? - It is peculiar.
Now, get in the car.
Unless I'm under arrest, you can get the hell out of here.
Well, alright, Conan O'Brien.
Good rhythm really don't care Yea-a-ah! Wow.
What? This is not remotely ethical.
Sure it is.
Hey, man! We had to cramp you home.
You good? You're gonna pay for this! We'll give him another second.
Ta da da ta da da [clicks tongue.]
He's in a trunk This is illegal, man.
You can go to jail for this.
You lost those rights when you let bad guys on to the tarmac to shoot people and steal old statues.
I wasn't involved.
They almost killed me.
Yeah, but they didn't.
And only thing of value that you have in is your flat screen.
And I'm seriously considering having my cousin Gerald come by later to steal it, now talk! [crashes.]
- Oh-ho! - Oh, come on, man! I didn't mean for that to happen.
These men were from Hong Kong like me, weren't they? Did any of them have this mark? They're Quantou, you're a loose end.
They will find you and they will kill you.
Just like they killed your friend Nick.
And my sister.
Lee is that for real? She was one of the officers on the plane.
They said they were robbing a plane.
I didn't know they were gonna kill anybody.
How did they contact you? Where did you meet? There's this restaurant in Chinatown supposed to have the best noodles in the city.
It's got this smokin' hot ass hostess.
It's called, uh [gunshots.]
[instrumental music.]
Nothing here to see just a kid like me Trying to cut some teeth trying to figure it out Nothing better to do when I'm stuck on you I'm still in here trying to figure it out [tires screeching.]
I'll let it go cause I won't see you later And we're not allowed to talk it out I said I'd go put myself on show But I'm still trying to figure it out I broke my shoe tripped and fell on you But you didn't know I planned it out I said I'd go yeah I won't see you later And we're not allowed to figure it out [grunts.]
[gunshots.]
[engine revving.]
(Carter) Lee! Nothing here to see just a kid like me Go home, brother.
Trying to figure it out Lee, I'm coming.
[engine revving.]
(Carter) Didi is a good friend.
She loves when I stop by.
Lee, I'm only making food for you, okay? Now, if you wanna share with that jackass, it's your call! I'll think about it.
Look.
I know you've had a heavy week, man.
You hear your sister was killed, you come half way around the world to find out she's alive and runnin' with some bad people.
For what it's worth, I'm glad came as it did.
But at least, now you get it.
You don't want Kim goin' to jail anymore than I want Gerald locked up.
Kim has betrayed her country and her family.
She must go to jail.
That's cold, man.
Are you a robot? I won't tell anyone if you are.
Are you a Chinese robot from the future? No.
Didi, uh I grabbed this shell casin' from the gun that killed Sterling.
I'm not really in a position to use department's resources right now.
No, you're not.
Think you get the ballistics on this for me? Thanks, Didi.
- Uncle Carter's here.
Uncle Carter's here.
- Hey, Hey.
Hey, that's right! How's my little man? - Killin' it.
- You're killin' it.
Hey, Lee, tell Didi about the congpou.
- Quantou.
- Yeah.
Same thing.
So how did Kim fall in with them? I don't know.
She always felt I was holding her back but this was such a foolish choice.
Kim was a great officer.
I should have let her do more.
Why didn't you? Our father was a cop.
He was tough.
All about rules and order.
Mom was more of a free spirit like Kim.
She made him human.
They died in a car accident.
Kim was just fifteen.
And I had to be more than just a brother.
I only wanted to protect her.
You and Carter, both worry so much about the people in your life.
I used to be his partner.
And everybody thinks that he dumped me and got me stuck on a desk but the truth is once I had Derek I didn't wanna be on the street anymore.
But if I asked out, ugh the other cops would never let me hear the end of it.
So Carter took the heat.
You know, he doesn't have many people in his life.
But he really protects the ones that he has.
Like you with Kim.
You and Carter are a lot alike.
I consider that the greatest insult of my life.
I get that.
Lee, we gotta go.
We gotta go.
Captain wants to know what we've been up to, alright? So no matter what, we have not been involved in this investigation, cool? But we have been very involved.
Look, I can get in serious trouble.
- Just lie, alright? - Absolutely not! Just say as little as you can.
- She picks up on everythin'.
- She? Guess female police chiefs aren't real common in China, huh? Just remember that in the US, a woman of power still strives to hold on to her femininity.
So it's customary to compliment her body.
Captain, this is Detective Lee.
Detective Lee, I'm Lindsay Cole.
Nice to meet you, captain.
You have beautiful legs.
Sorry, captain.
You know what? We should go.
- I'll go talk to him.
- No, no, no.
I-I'll take it as a compliment.
- You'd kill me if I said that.
- Yeah.
Because you don't look like an Asian Orlando Bloom.
Agent Murray called me about a security guard at the Burbank Airport who was killed.
A Richard Sterling.
I don't know anything about this guy.
Come on, let's go.
And my new friend? You don't know anything about the murder of Richard Sterling? [intense music.]
[mouthing.]
Please.
Please No.
Bye.
[door closes.]
That's the first time I lied to a superior officer.
You go walk that right off.
No big thing at all.
Thomas.
If you are here, that means the FBI has not made substantial progress.
[sighs.]
You are unfortunately correct.
The Chinese Government's ready to pay the ransom and be done with it.
We've learned that the Quantou were behind the heist.
I have no hard evidence yet, but I won't stop until I do.
Well, I can't get involved until you have something real, but if you get it contact me and I'll back you up.
Thank you, Thomas.
Why didn't you tell that guy your sister's still alive? Kim is for me to deal with.
You can't send her to jail, can you? It'd just be like me with Gerald.
If the FBI pursues her, Kim can be killed.
She must go to jail, but I don't want her dead.
""I don't want her dead.
"" That's the nicest thing I've ever heard you say.
That's progress, Lee.
Sterling said he met his contact at a restaurant in Chinatown.
Someplace that has fantastic noodles.
Yeah.
And apparently a smokin' hot ass hostess.
We find her, we find the Pai-Gow.
- The Quantou.
- The same thing.
(Carter) I don't understand how two blocks back that way we were in my country because now, damn! It's exactly like a Chinese market.
(Carter) Come on, let's just find this noodle place.
Uh.
Excuse me? Do you know where I could find - Okay, excuse me? Do you know - No.
Excuse me? Do you know where I can find a noodle pla You just gonna keep on walkin' I oughta knock you ass Man, what's wrong with these people? You're in my town now.
[speaking in Chinese.]
Hey, do you know where I could find a inside-out rabbit? Look at that.
- Carter.
- Hey, what's up? They're torn between their two favorite noodle stores.
- We have try both.
- Let's go.
Hopefully, one of them will have a hot ass hostess.
Hey, look at you.
Man, it feels like we've been to every noodle place in Chinatown.
Why do you talk so much? [indistinct chattering.]
This is it.
I'm not sure.
There are limited exits.
Few places to run from enemies.
On the other hand, turn your attention to the booty over there.
- Note the booty, Lee.
- The booty is noted.
- Just let me handle this.
Hey! - Hello.
Uh, I'd like to check out some of your, uh, private rooms.
I'm throwing a noodle theme bachelor party [intense music.]
Carter! [gunshots.]
[screaming.]
Police, police, move! Get out! Get out! [screaming.]
[music continues.]
Ah! [grunting.]
Excuse me! Excuse me! Move! Move! Move! Move! [grunting.]
Kim! - You don't have to do this.
- It's too late for me.
Don't! Just kill him! [gunshot.]
Lee! Lee! Lee! Lee! [police radio chattering.]
A shot from that close and she just misses? She couldn't kill me.
But she needed her boss to think that she had.
When she fired, I reacted as I had to, for her.
If she couldn't bring herself to shoot you, that means she's not all the way bad.
Look, man, I think there may still be a chance for you to save her.
And if there is, you have to try.
Silence? You agree with me, don't you? You do? Yes! Hey, man, let me ask you, how scared were you when Chinese Eminem told Kim to shoot you? I have no use for fear, it is a distraction.
I rode outside of a helicopter.
Outside! You're not braver than me, man.
Hey, Carter, Captain Cole wants you back at the station.
And it gives me great pleasure to tell you she's pissed.
- I hate you, Donovan.
- I'm glad.
What an ass.
[laughs.]
That's funny.
Come on, let's go, man.
Is there a single thing you can possibly say in your defense? And I should also mention that if I detect the slightest degree of insincerity or sarcasm in any word leaving your mouth, I will shoot you, then bring you back to life and shoot you again.
We were following what we believe was a solid lead on the people that killed the Chinese cops and stole those Okay, that's enough.
Captain, this is my fault.
I made Carter help me.
Oh! Yes, right, because he's such a pushover.
I get weak around Asian men.
And this one's a dreamboat.
Carter, you're done.
Full suspension.
And I know that you probably think that I take some degree of pleasure in that, I don't.
I wanted you to get back to work, but you just can't seem to stay out of your own way, can you? Detective Lee your captain wants to speak to you.
Sir, I respectfully request more time.
I believe there still is a chance that we can I'll return to Hong Kong right away.
I understand.
(Lindsay) I'm sorry, gentlemen, it's over.
Hey! They weren't kiddin' about sending you home immediately, huh? Sure you don't wanna put that shaving-kit in your suitcase? This is my suitcase.
I'm gonna miss these moments.
Come on, man.
Hey, for what it's worth, I didn't hate working with you.
I didn't like it, but I didn't hate it either.
Anythin' you wanna say to me? Yes.
You are illegally parked.
Pretty funny, pretty funny.
I'm the funny one though.
Remember that.
[cellphone ringing.]
- Yo! - Hey.
So that bullet you had me take to ballistics, they just handed me the report.
I think you can probably pass that information on to someone who's currently a police officer.
(Didi) Are you sure? Because who is your favorite chopper pilot/gun smuggler? Carlos.
I'mma hit you back.
Yo, get in the car.
I gotta make a stop.
I'm supposed to be getting on a plane.
Man, get your ass in the car, Lee.
I cannot violate a direct order from my captain.
Was that the end of that sentence? I'm sorry, I thought you were about to add ""so make sure not to tell anyone.
"" Look.
If you choose to fly back now, you'll make it back to Hong Kong with your code of honor all shining and intact.
It's not an option, it's an order.
But those Quantou punks will still be out there killing people.
And you'll probably never see Kim again.
Look, I know in your head it seems like this is just about you.
It's not.
If I could close this case out, I can prove myself to Cole and get back on the job.
And I won't admit this to a lot of people but this job is all I have.
Now, I'm goin' all in to finish what we started.
But I don't know if I can get that done without you.
You do have a choice, Lee.
You just have to be willin' to make it.
You have corrupted my soul.
Ya-a-a-ay! Well, I have been known to have that effect on people.
- [car horn honking.]
- Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
LAPD.
Get your ass out of the way! Hi, Carlos.
I don't know if you remember me.
Kiss my ass, man.
Look, I've had a bad day.
And no one in here is gonna care if I take that out on you.
We just have a few questions.
You give me answers, maybe I can help you out.
We have a shell casing from a murder scene.
Fired from a rare type of firearm.
Type of gun I haven't seen anywhere but in a stash of weapons I was about to get from you.
You sell any of those guns to a Chinese gang? You said you can help me? - Prove it.
I don't trust you.
- [scoffs.]
Come on, man, have I ever lied to you? Aside from the time I pretended not to be a cop and bought a bunch of guns from you and shot you in your leg? Here.
Call your cell.
I'll leave a message.
Can't believe I'm using my day time minutes on your goofy ass.
This is Detective James Carter leaving a message for Carlos' attorney.
If the information Carlos gives me pans out, I'll make sure it's considered as States' evidence.
And I'll lobby to get him a reduced sentence.
What are you doing? You shouldn't be asking for more trouble now.
It's your sister, man.
We need anything you can tell us.
I delivered the guns to a mall.
Right, so you, you gave the Quantou a bunch of automatic weapons and then you all hit the food court and got to Cinepolis.
I didn't say it was a working mall.
It's empty.
(Carter) I don't know about you, but I don't see nothin' down here.
Okay.
Yeah, cool, you take the second floor, I'll keep watch down here.
[intense music.]
[breathing heavily.]
I'm tired as hell, Lee.
[grunting.]
This is the place.
[cellphone ringing.]
Yeah.
Don't let them pay the ransom.
We found the statues, they are at an abandoned shopping mall.
2-7-5-3, Western Avenue.
Outstanding.
Are you there now? - Yes.
- I'm on my way.
I'm bringing the FBI, LAPD, just wait for backup.
Wait for backup.
Gentlemen we have a change of plan.
- You can stop counting? - Stop counting? Are you sure? I am.
[thudding.]
- Let's go in.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I wasn't eavesdroppin', but I think I just heard ""wait for backup.
"" Kim could be in here.
I have to go.
See, this is the real reason why I work alone.
You get caught up in each other's emotional stuff, it just gets complicated.
If you're scared and don't wanna come with me, I will understand.
I see what you doin'.
I see what you doin'.
There's been a lot of talk about who's braver.
- It's all from you.
- Yeah.
But if we're gonna do this, I think we can be honest and both admit that we're both scared.
- Okay.
- So you scared too.
No, but it's okay that you are.
You know what, if you're not scared at all, okay? Then going in there, that's no big deal for you.
Me? I'm terrified! So goin' in there makes me incredibly brave! - I'm so much braver than you! - I'm sure you are right.
It cannot be easy to act when terrified.
- Okay.
- I remember being scared once.
As a small child, it was unpleasant.
You don't make me feel bad about myself.
Hurt my feelings.
Hey, hey, hey, wait for me.
Why you walkin' so fast? You still think you're braver than me, don't you? Just 'cause you walked your ass in here all quick and stuff? You ain't braver than me.
I'm gonna show you.
I'mma prove it to you.
- Those are the statues? - What do they look like? - Okay.
- Be careful not to touch them.
The value of the statues is greater than you can comprehend.
Yeah, yeah, y [gasps.]
Uh I respect that.
Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee.
[indistinct chattering.]
- There goes blondie.
- I don't see Kim.
[indistinct shouting.]
That might be bad.
[speaking in Chinese.]
Why aren't they shootin' at us? Even men of character this low won't risk damaging the statues.
They won't use guns.
Only fists.
[screaming.]
[grunting.]
It's time to fight dirty.
[gunshots.]
[grunting.]
[intense music.]
[grunting.]
Lee, here! [music continues.]
Easy, Kim, cops will be here any second.
My friend has tried to convince me that you still have a chance.
- I think he may be right.
- Hey, look, it's over, girl.
Just ask your boss.
He may not answer.
- Being dead and all.
- He was not my boss.
- Drop the gun.
- No.
You drop the gun.
Thomas, what are you doing? You never saw her real potential.
Fortunately, I have an eye for talent.
Get this done.
This isn't you, Kim.
This is not who you are.
Who am I? I should have died.
[speaking in Mandarin.]
No, you are not.
I know my sister.
You are brave, and you are strong.
And you couldn't kill me.
Well, luckily I can.
Ah! [grunting.]
Kim! [sighs.]
Are you okay? Negro, I have a bullet in me.
Hell, no, I ain't okay.
It stung at first.
Adrenaline must be dropping.
Holy crap, it hurts.
Yeah, you'll be okay.
You gotta admit, man.
This was pretty brave.
Took a bullet, tryin' to save you.
You are indeed brave.
I'm very impressed.
Why are you covered in blood? I was shot.
Why are you covered in blood in two places? Oh shot twice.
Well, clearly it's more painful to be shot once.
Why do you keep doin' this to me? That's it, where's my gun? I'mma shoot me somethin' both of my thighs.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's get outta here.
Ah! Hey, do you think your sister date black guys? [instrumental music.]
- Oh, my! Thanks, Didi! - Carter.
Yeah.
[cheering.]
Oh, Detective Carter.
Did you just call me detective? Do I have a job again? Yeah, I expect you back here tomorrow.
Tomorrow? I got shot.
Got six stiches.
Very deep stiches.
Uh-huh.
Hey, what y'all talkin' about? I was just about to ask Lee how he's feeling.
Uh, I'm okay.
A little weak from the surgery.
We get it! You got surgery.
So when are you headed back to China? I have no family there to get back to.
And Kim is here, and the Quantou is here.
Fortunately, Captain Chen saw the benefit of having me transferred to Los Angeles, and Lindsay Captain Cole has offered me a full time position working at the LAPD.
Okay, look you startin' to see the benefit of havin' a partner.
I guess I won't be opposed Now that I'm a detective, I just want you to know that I'm going to arrest your cousin Gerald.
What? Hey, that's funny! Hey, Lee! Hey, don't do that.
Hey, don't be that! Hey, hey, don't.
My grandma gonna be mad! Don't do that!",fail

Case number 34HC710, State vs.
Mr.
Douglas Riller.
We are here to consider the bail request for Mr.
Riller, who's accused of two charges of bigamy, multiple counts of fraud, and one count of falsifying identity.
Appears as though hotshot here had two families at once.
You're the player who likes to play, Mr.
Riller.
How do you answer to these charges? Not guilty, Your Honor.
I love them all equally.
How can love be a crime? Well, you've clearly never been to Thailand.
Trial date will be set and bail Your Honor, we have expert testimony that Mr.
Riller is a flight risk, and ask that bail be denied.
Really, Tom? He's got no priors.
- You want to do this? - Yeah.
I really want to do this.
I'd like to call Dr.
Gary Boyd to the witness stand.
Hello, Dr.
Boyd.
Hello, Judge Wright.
So, Dr.
Gary Boyd, in your expert opinion, as one of the most prominent psychiatrists in the state of California, does the accused pose an undue risk of flight? All right, Counselor, a word.
Right in the middle of something.
You know this is just to determine if Romeo here is a flight risk, not an audition for A Few Good Men? Sorry if my questioning doesn't work for your hangover, - but it's protocol.
- Yeah? Are tight pants part of your protocol too? These pants are fitted.
All right, just lay off the grandstanding, Tom, all right? And let your junk breathe.
You may want to have kids someday.
My eyes are up here.
[Clears throat.]
Dr.
Boyd, carry on.
Your Honor, Mr.
Riller is a very real flight risk who shows classic sociopathic tendencies.
He consistently establishes intimate relationships, and then flees when there are consequences.
Mr.
Riller's also quite charming.
He already has a date with his lawyer.
I object.
That is a work dinner.
And karaoke.
[Bangs gavel.]
Overruled.
Mr.
Riller, are you a flight risk? Your Honor, absolutely not.
I am a family man with deep roots in this community.
Ask either of my wives.
Just answer one question.
Does Air Avianca fly nonstop to Costa Rica? - Don't answer that.
- Only if you take the 10:20, otherwise there's a layover in Mexico City.
- Oh.
- Someone's been looking into travel to the only country in this hemisphere without a U.
S.
extradition policy.
Bail is denied.
[Bangs gavel.]
Boo-yah! Dr.
Boyd, a word with you in my chambers.
Yes, Your Honor.
[Both moaning.]
Three times on your desk in one month? - Nice.
- Well, three times ever.
Well, except for our World Cup hookup.
Oh, wait, the other night too.
There was no World Cup hookup with you and me.
No, really? Nope.
Sorry.
Whoa.
Are you sure? Okay, yeah.
That was us.
Gary! [Laughs.]
- Oh.
- Uh, what's what's that? Oh, that is a box that once contained a pregnancy test.
Mm-hmm, no, I get that.
But hey, we use We use condoms every time, right? You are correct, sir.
- Are you doing sex math? - I am.
So you you're sleeping with other people, or it's just you and me, and you thought you were pregnant with my whoa, okay.
No, but yes, in that you are not the only you, you know.
I do, I do.
I'm a pretty evolved cat.
It's all good.
Hey, let's go back to that, um, pregnancy test thing for a sec.
- Negative, right? - Yes.
- Hey, Your Honor oh, damn! - Hey.
DA-ha-ha-Mn.
Not bad, Your Honor.
Not bad at all.
And, Dr.
Boyd, hey, you been in the gym? Two-a-days? You look good, man.
We were just reenacting a case scenario.
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm, yeah, a case.
I know that case.
I've seen it late-night on Cinemax.
Oh, which one? Witness For The Sexecution or Sequester Sister wait, no, I remember.
Juror's Box.
The hey, keep this dude around.
All right, Tedward, what do you want? All right, Judge Hernandez needs you to file a motion for him by the end of the day, and Lincoln Elementary School is on line one, Mr.
Robby Shoemaker.
Oh, Robby.
Robby, Robby, Robby.
I heard ""Lincoln Elementary School"" from out in the hall.
- Do not take that call.
- Hi, Your Honor.
Of course I'm gonna take the call.
It's what I do.
Hello, Robby.
Okay, dude, trust me when I tell you that you have no leverage, all right? So don't say a thing.
You're ten years old.
Nobody's gonna negotiate with you, got it? I'm gonna be there as soon as I can.
- No, you're not.
- Bye.
This is not happening.
Sir, I put both of his parents in prison.
If the kid needs a little legal something-something, I'm gonna help him.
His mother is 18 months clean and sober.
It works if you work it.
So work it.
You're worth it.
Keep coming back.
Although, you know what? I did not go back.
Sir, sir, two more months.
His mom's got two more months on her sentence, and he's ten years old.
Your job is to clear cases for the state of California.
Is this kid more important than the state of California? Well, he's not less important.
- Mm, damn.
- Nice! What? What's the emergency? I knew you'd come, 'cause you feel guilty.
That was a mandatory sentencing, and it was not my fault.
[Sighs.]
Well, I'm here.
Might as well work my magic.
What are the charges? I drew a picture of my P.
E.
Teacher, Mr.
Pembert.
Mm-hmm.
With big-ass boobies.
[Chuckles.]
I mean, were they like Principal Johnson will see you now.
I'm Robby Shoemaker's counsel.
You know you can't get rid of your guilt by buying me off with ice cream, pizza, and cash.
- Fine, give it back.
- Okay, you can buy me off.
All right, you know what, dude? Buy you off? I got your sentence reduced from two weeks detention to an apology to your teacher.
I mean, frankly, you should be buying me off.
And you have a hickey on your neck.
I do not have a hickey.
Oh, man, I got a hickey.
That must be from Gary.
All right.
Keep going to the corner.
I seriously don't need Alfonso seeing a judge drop me off.
Who's Alfonso? Alfonso's a 12-year-old kid who can already grow a beard.
His hobbies include beating on me, and watching kung-fu movies so he can find new ways to beat on me.
- See you next time.
- All right.
Wait, wait, wait, no, there's not gonna be a next time.
Hey, hey, hey.
Seriously.
This was a one-time thing.
Do not call me again.
- Hey, Mami.
- You Alfonso? I'll be whoever you want me to be.
Damn, you can grow a beard, dude.
You want to get some pesce and some white wine? No, I do not want to dine with you, sir.
You leave Robby alone.
You hear me? I'm serious, I will cut you.
I am officially asking you not to take the calls from children or sisters or parents or husbands of the people you lock up.
Okay, how about email? Snapchat? Tinder? Can I take those? I wish you'd rethink this.
[Elevator bell rings.]
I know what I'm doing.
Oh, wait.
Is this going up? Hump de bump, doop bodu Hump de bump, doop bop - Whoo! - Hump de bump Oh, oh, sorry.
Sorry, dude.
Chili peppers.
Involuntary, sorry.
- Morning, Judge.
- Hey.
What's up? Your cafe con leche.
Gracias.
One breakfast burrito con todo.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, try this fresh salsa.
- Don't worry, it's mild.
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.
You like that? [Chokes.]
Mild? For who, the devil? [Coughs.]
Gene Simmons? I feel like I just made out with Godzilla.
It's muy caliente.
[Laughs.]
Whoa, okay.
Personal space, dude.
That one's on you.
Hmm? Whatever.
Hump de bump, doop bodu Hump de bump, doop bop Hump de bump - Hey, Your Honor.
- What's happening? You might want to take the back way.
Judge Hernandez is waiting on you.
You should have filed that motion.
He's ""old guy on the verge of a aneurysm"" mad.
Okay? He's like You know what, I deal with mentally unstable criminals all day long, and I'm sure I can handle a slightly irritated Judge Hernandez.
- Oh, all right.
- Where are you going? Oh.
I'm eating a bomb-sicle.
Security says we have to go outside to eat them because it involved the word ""bomb.
"" Crazy, right? - 2014 is a trip.
- Word.
Later.
- Well, hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.
You're not trying to, you know - What? - Accidentally run into me like, ""oh, Rebecca, hey.
What's up, girl?"" No, Smith v.
Clark.
Yeah, testifying for the defense.
If that's okay with you, your ego.
I mean, Your Honor.
Ouch.
Really? No, I'm just kidding.
I don't care.
- Do what you want.
- A little bit.
- You care a little bit? - Unh-uh.
Come on.
Burn through a box of condoms and a jug of Tequila, you'll come crawling back.
Whoa-ho, don't hold your breath, my friend.
- We'll see.
- Oh, come come on, Gary.
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, this is your hickey! That's a song, you guys.
If it makes you feel any better this is your hickey, Gary Oh, oh - [Elevator bell rings.]
- Know that there was a case back in 1983 - Mm-hmm.
- Well, if it isn't little miss trainwreck.
There you are, Judge Hernandez.
I've been looking for you.
Judge Wright, I specifically asked you to file that motion.
I know, sir.
I'm so sorry.
I had an emergency come up.
No, lying.
See, that is a lie.
She was out there helping her at-risk youth.
Might I suggest an official sanction? [Phone rings.]
Could be any closer to me right now? - Sorry.
- Oh, sir, if you'll excuse me just one moment, I've got to take this call.
No, no, no, no, no.
Do not take that call.
You are a judge, not a social worker.
Fine, okay.
But just so you know, you can't blame Robby for me not filing that motion, okay? I wanted this to be a surprise thank you, Tom.
- You're welcome.
- But I got tapped to give the Dunham law commencement speech.
I've been kind of lost in my speech writing.
Oh, you're the keynote? - I am.
- I'm a trustee.
- Yes, I know that, sir.
- I'll be there.
- I look forward to it.
- Oh, me too.
Maybe we should car pool.
I'll meet you there.
Let's just we'll all meet I'm going to see him there too.
Oh, you just wormed your way - out of not filing that motion.
- Yeah, I did.
You know, she didn't file that moti - He's gone.
- God, your grasp Your grasp is always just exceeding the reach.
- Oh, oh, oh, that must suck, huh? - [Phone rings.]
Oh, look, I got a call from Lincoln Elementary.
I got to take it.
Judge Wright.
[Mocking tone.]
Judge Wright.
I still don't know why Judge Wright is here for this meeting.
I mean, it is an elementary school.
Ms.
Wright is a mentor and a very important judge.
[Belches.]
Excuse me, so sorry.
I had wine and cake for breakfast.
So which gang recruited Robby? A gang? There's been a misunderstanding.
Robby drew an offensive portrait.
Okay, apparently I was misled again.
May I see the picture, please? Oh.
It's you, Mr.
Thorpe.
Except your head is a penis.
Actually it's very good.
He really got you.
I mean, did you evaluate this? I did evaluate it, yes.
So, here's the story.
Robby is having a tough time in his group home.
He's a victim of bullying and fighting.
And so I'm sure this is just a cry out for attention.
- Right, Robby? - No.
I just think Mr.
Thorpe's head looks like a dong.
That's not acceptable! Mr.
Thorpe, can we just look at this as an artistic expression of a frustrated child who would benefit more from guidance and understanding rather than punishment? - I don't like it.
- I understand.
I realize I have an oddly shaped head.
But I'm sensitive about it.
Mr.
Thorpe, I understand, and if you'll just let me take care of this, I promise you it will never happen again.
Thanks so much, and you might want to just consider switching your part.
Might help cover the curvature.
- Okay, thank you.
- All right, okay.
I'd be happy to do portraits of your family.
- All right, that's enough.
- Oh, come on now.
[Grunts.]
First off, you got to stop lying to get me to show up.
It's not cool.
Second, you got to notify the head of the group home, document the bullying, and then file a police report.
All right.
When this kid Alfonso comes at you, you hold up your hands like you're afraid to fight.
Like that, right? And then boom! You punch him in the nose as hard as you can.
Nothing scares a bully like seeing his own blood.
- Hmm? - You know, that's the best advice a grown-up's given me in a long time.
Really? You think I'm a grown-up? Well, if you're asking me, then you really got problems.
Nice.
All right, let me see your right.
Again, harder.
Yeah.
Get out of my Van.
Mr.
Riller, before I pronounce sentencing, is there anything you or anyone on your behalf - would like to say? - Your Honor, Mrs.
Riller and Mrs.
Riller have agreed to petition the court for leniency.
Your Honor, I knew Douglas Riller as a loving husband and father to my two children from a previous marriage.
Your Honor, I too knew Douglas Riller as a loving husband and father to our two dobermans.
And although I am not happy about his lies, I have to say that he's always been there for me when I'm sick, and supportive when I was down.
He was also there for me when I was sick, and supportive when I was down, except for a few times when she was sick at the same time.
Then it got tricky.
Wow.
I'm sorry.
Please continue.
The point is Douglas was there for us.
Did he lie? Did he deceive? Yes.
But at the end of the day, isn't any relationship, romantic or otherwise, about showing up for someone over and over again? About someone being there for someone when you need them most? How many of us have ever experienced that? Well, I have.
And I'm thankful for it.
So please, show Douglas mercy, please.
Oh, that's that's beautiful.
Effed up all at the same time.
That's kind of crazy.
Mr.
Riller, I sentence you to time served for the charges of bigamy, and one month for the charge of falsifying identity and fraud.
Additionally I sentence you to take a course in feminism, the college of your choice while wearing this T-shirt to class every day.
What? How am I gonna pick up girls? [Bangs gavel.]
[Muttering.]
Congratulations.
But the exhilirating and terrifying truth is that - [Knock at door.]
- Not now, go away, bad time.
- [Knocking continues.]
- I said go away.
Are you deaf? I punched Alfonso like you said.
Dude, I mean your timing Your timing is not very good.
I'm in the middle of writing a speech.
- I got to go.
- He's got brothers, and cousins, and one really big, and I mean big, big sister.
All right, here's what you do.
You call your case worker.
All right? Tell her tonight.
And then I will deal with this tomorrow, first thing.
They said they're sending me to Edgewater.
I don't even know what that is.
- Edgewater? - Yeah.
No.
Edgewater's aw Edgewater is for super, super violent kids.
They will eat you alive.
- You told me to hit him.
- I know.
I know I did, okay? It's my fault.
I'm gonna fix it.
I'm gonna fix it.
- I'll stay at your place.
- No, no, you won't.
Nobody lives with me.
I mean, I don't keep anything I killed a cactus.
All I need is a warm garage and a cold pizza.
[Sighs.]
Come on, I got to go.
Let's go.
Robby, honey, dude, I mean, you probably think I'm this, you know, awesome judge - who has it all together.
- Nope.
I think you're a mess.
But you owe me one.
Oh, what I owe you, sir, by law, is a suitable environment for the next 58 days until your mom gets out.
I am not a suitable anything, okay? I'm a workaholic freakshow.
I eat crap all day, I drink until I drop, you know? I might binge-watch Lock-up, 'cause I put half of those guys in there.
I mean, sometimes I have to tie a rope from my ankle to the bed 'cause I don't even know what I do at night.
So you get to keep wrecking my life? First, you put my parents away, then you got me kicked out of a halfway decent group home, and now I have to go live with violent guys? Come on, Judge.
Can't you just put me back the way you found me? [Knocking.]
Let's just stick to the protocol that we talked about, and yeah, - see you next week.
- I need a favor.
- One second.
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't thank me, man.
Healing is a team sport.
Okay, I don't have time to watch you pretend to be on the phone with patients.
Yeah, well, you didn't exactly crawl here, but you're here.
Oh, and you brought a date.
You know, you're really taking this whole cougar thing to the next level.
All right, Robby Shoemaker, Dr.
Gary Boyd.
I need a letter from an expert in the field stating that Robby is not a violent child, but that he was acting in self-defense against a bully so that he can stay in his current group home, and not get transferred to Edgewater.
Ooh, Edgewater? Yikes.
58 days, man.
It's the home stretch.
Do you think you can keep your hands to yourself for that long? In my sleep.
I'm not like the judge over here.
You know what I'm saying? Right, let's go.
We're late.
- Good.
- Thank you.
The exhilarating and terrifying truth is that nothing adequately prepares you for how it feels to uphold the law.
Is there a chance that you will be swallowed whole by your job? Yes.
Absolutely.
Before you know it, you'll be using the nearest teaspoon as your makeup mirror, or to adjust the knot in your tie.
And it's gonna freak you out at first, by the way, because no one tells you that you appear upside down in a spoon, but you do.
And it's an excellent reminder because the very spirit of the law is about making things right side up and doing whatever you can to keep it that way.
[Applause.]
Oh, what's up? There's my man.
Hey, what are you no, he can't be in here.
He's underaged.
Here's my I.
D.
- Give me that.
- Looks official to me.
Oh, where did you get your medical degree, Dr.
Lee Trang? Hey, guys.
You know Mary Harmon from Child Services? You got him in a bar, Rebecca? At 10:00 P.
M.
? I thought it was 9:30.
And this will keep Robby out of Edgewater permanently.
Nice.
Drinks on the house, everyone.
- The judge is buying.
- What? No, I'm not buying.
I'm not buying drinks.
I'm very cheap.
All right, oh, hey, hey.
Don't forget this, all right? - Thanks for everything, Judge.
- You got it.
Take care of yourself, all right? Okay.
And yeah, yeah, call me anytime.
Any time at all, Robby.
Preferably during business hours.
Hey, hey, hey, Judge Hernandez.
That was Robby Shoemaker.
Yeah, I kept him off the streets, out of juvie, turns out.
That's what happens when you take the call.
How can I be mad at you after that great speech you gave tonight? - Oh.
- Truly.
In fact, I'm gonna buy you a round.
Oh.
Anything you like From the two bottom shelves.
Bartender, hi.
Can you get the McAllister 24, throw that on the bottom shelf, get us a round? - Make hers a double.
- See, Gary? That is why you're my favorite Gary.
Well, actually Busey is.
Gary Busey's strong.
But you're second.
Busey? He's gonna beat me? Yes.
Thank you for the letter.
You're welcome.
[The Donnas' Dancing With Myself plays.]
This song.
I love this song.
Oh! Give her some room.
Give her a wide berth, guys.
You might want to give her some personal space.
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Oh! [Scatting.]
Judge, you gotta stop that.
All right.
Actually, I kind of hurt my neck.
[Laughter.]
All right.
Anyway.
Here's to us.
- Yeah! - Hey! Dancing with myself Oh oh oh Dancing with myself",fail
5,"Are You There, Chelsea?","The best thing about December 17th is that I finally power-slurped the worm out of a high-end bottle of tequila.
The worst thing? I got a DUI and ended up in Essex county jail.
Since it was my first time in lockdown, I didn't know what to expect.
My new roommates were mostly inked-up tweakers.
Except for one.
I don't know what her crime was, but it was obviously fashion related.
What are you looking at, Barbie? Think you're better than me? No.
I was just thinking you would benefit from a really good bra.
Is that your idea of some kind of joke? It was quickly becoming apparent to me that this situation was much more serious than I had realized.
Then it hit me I had to make friends with this woman, really quickly.
I'll be in your bunk an hour after lights out.
Mmm.
Wow! Perhaps I thought too fast.
My friendly overture had made the situation even worse.
So I did what I do whenever I really screw up I prayed.
Are you there, vodka? It's me, Chelsea.
I know I messed up, but if you let me out of this cell, I swear I'll turn my life around.
Hey, blonde.
Time to go home.
Damn, you're good.
What? It was a December 17th miracle.
My judge-y, super-Christian sister Sloane came to bail me out.
Sloane, thanks for this.
You're the best.
Hey, you.
Cross your legs, will you? Thank you for getting arrested, by the way.
I really enjoyed using a prison toilet for the first time.
And hopefully my unborn baby will enjoy her Chlamydia.
I'm 39 weeks pregnant and my husband's in Afghanistan, and you're the one who's supposed to drive me to the hospital.
I am tired of bailing you out.
Sloane, you never bail me out.
Yes, I see the irony.
I lived with you in the basement for a week after you wrecked dad's car.
Nobody is a good driver when they're 13.
And what about the time I handled dad when you and Olivia had those marines in your bedroom? It was veterans day.
We were being patriotic.
Holding a flag between your legs is not patriotism.
I'm really changing things.
I even prayed in the holding cell, Sloane.
Vodka is not the lord.
Are you sure? They're both invisible and have a hand in unexplained pregnancies.
Wow, Chelsea.
A DUI.
Man, congratulations.
Now you've officially done everything under the influence.
That's helpful.
Thank you.
I would have driven her, except I passed out on the couch in the ladies room.
What's your excuse? Well, I was mopping up the floor around the couch in the ladies room.
So loudly.
Olivia has been my best friend since grade school.
Ever since we were little, she's always had my back.
Some people have pit bulls hey, watch it! Ooh! I have Olivia.
Chels, listen to me.
You know what your problem is? I work with a bartender who gives unsolicited advice? No.
You're trying to drink like a guy.
Last night I drank like two guys.
Well, believe me, guys don't like that.
Oh, no.
How will I ever hook me a man? In order to understand my strange and complicated relationship with Rick, you need to know something.
One night, less than 3 years ago, we got really drunk and discovered we shared one trait that would forever keep us from hooking up.
We both like to be on top.
I'll it.
I'll get it.
I'm gonna get it I got it.
It's gotten.
I'll get it! Oh, you're such a man.
You won.
Hello! Jerry's ultimate sports bar.
If you can't finish your drinks, our waitress will.
Man, I'm going to have to make some big changes in my life.
Are you going to quit drinking? Yeah.
Right after I quit dry-humping.
Heads up! That's Todd, our bar back.
We all feel sorry for him because of his obvious challenge.
Here's your limes.
Todd, these are lemons.
He's colorblind.
Do you know anybody that is looking for an apartment? 'Cause there's a girl in my building that's looking for roommates.
Your apartment's like a block from here, right? Yeah.
Ok.
Do you see what's happening? A plan is presenting itself.
This is how it works for me.
I get a DUI, and then all of a sudden an apartment walking distance from work mysteriously opens up.
Great, so that's your plan, then? You're gonna move a block away from work and just continue to drink as much as you ever did? Well, if I'm that close, I should probably drink more.
113 114 115 steps from the bar.
Huh.
I got 2-0-4.
Hey, you must be Chelsea and Olivia.
Come on in.
The bachelor's about to hand out the final rose, so I hope you can wait to talk about the apartment.
If you saw it last night, don't spoil it.
Oop! They're flashing back to the hot tub.
I can't watch this with people.
It's too dirty.
Brownies? I just made them.
They're still warm.
If these have hash in them, I want to marry you and adopt a biracial baby.
You're so funny.
I'm not that funny.
But I do have a pretty good joke book.
Hold on.
Wow.
This place is sweet.
I know.
It's giving me lady wood.
Are you sure it's not from that black guy in the elevator? 'Cause that's what's working me right now.
I've gotta get this place, Olivia.
And you need to move in with me.
I know.
I have got to get out of my parents' house.
My clothes smell like kimchi.
Plus, this place is closer to Manhattan.
Don't you have a job interview tomorrow? For an unpaid internship.
I was such an idiot to major in journalism.
No, you were an idiot to go to college.
And even if I do get a real job, it'll probably pay half of what I make at the bar.
Then why do it? Because it's the American dream.
You people made it up.
Knock, knock.
Who's there? Interrupting cow.
Interrupting cow who? Moo.
Oh! Ha ha ha! Love.
Hi, dad.
Hi, sweetie.
Your big sister told me about your DUI.
Nice work, Chelsea.
She is such a narc.
You need a lecture, or did you learn your lesson? I learned my lesson.
Good.
Enough said.
Hey, look.
I got you a camera to film Sloane's birth.
Are you sure? I don't want to tape over the Kennedy assassination.
How about ""thank you,"" little missy? My dad hates shelling out money for anything.
Dad, this isn't a cabbage patch doll.
It's a lettuce leaf kid.
Dad, I'm not using that piece of crap to film the birth of my first niece.
I don't know what it is with you girls about filming down there, anyway.
I was in Vietnam, and the worst thing I saw was a young gal giving birth on the side of the road.
It was a total bloodbath.
Hey, Chels, you know, we just got a new video camera for the bar so we can show people dancing on the monitors.
Here.
Melvin, dance a little bit.
Right.
Picture that, but with hot women.
Well, here, you can borrow it if you want.
What? Rick, you are like the king of hooking me up.
The camera, the apartment.
I know we've had our differences, but I am this close to giving you a handie.
Hey! If he's a gentleman.
Hey, Todd, what you got there? Well, inspired by you, Chels, I started a little side business where I drive drunk people home in their own cars.
And then you drive home on this thing? Yeah.
It folds up and I put it in the trunk.
And I put my pedal extenders in my backpack.
Hey, can I leave some of these coupons at the bar? ""Driving miss drunkie.
"" Nice! I'm not allowed to drive right now, but I will hand these out.
I'm very influential in the drunk community.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting.
Dad, don't pee in the alley.
Don't drink and drive.
Huh? Jeez, look at that dude.
All right, look, before you knock him, he's actually a really cool guy.
He's smart, too.
He's in I.
T.
And I think he went to Harvard.
Uh-huh.
Really? He should have gone to clown college and learned to pull fish out of his pants, like the good lord intended.
Hey, man.
I'm Jonathan.
Rick, right? Hey, yeah.
You drink, uh, vodka and right.
More vodka.
Vodka and more vodka? That's my drink.
I'm Chelsea, by the way.
It occurred to me that I had judged another human being based on his horrible clown hair without even bothering to find out what he drinks.
I began to admire him for having the confidence to walk around with a lid like that.
Obviously it wasn't his fault he was a redhead.
It was his gross ancestors.
Clearly some old bitch back there shagged the court Jester.
What an interesting person.
See, maybe I should go out with someone like that.
Even if he does look like Kathy Griffin.
Is he single? Well, more importantly, is he a bottom? I don't need someone who's always a bottom, Rick.
Just sometimes a bottom.
Sometimes.
Hey, whatever you need to tell yourself, Chels.
I was there.
Hey, guys.
Quick question.
Do you want to go out sometime? Yeah.
My treat.
Me? And don't worry, we'll go somewhere cheap so you don't feel pressured to put out.
Oh, I have low self-esteem, so I always put out.
Bottoms up! Like 98% of women who can see, I'd never been a fan of the redheaded male.
But Jonathan was really sweet.
So I took him to a place where he wouldn't stick out like a freckled sore thumb.
Tommy o'Flanagan's Irish pub.
Wow, great place.
I thought you'd like it.
I do.
You know what else I like? Your hair.
It looks really pretty tonight.
Thanks.
And how about your Shirt.
It's very nice.
Oh, would you like another pint? I don't know, I'm kind of full.
Would it be cool if I unbuttoned the top of my pants? If you want, you can just take them off and wrap my coat around you.
I like where this is going.
I probably should have asked Dee Dee if it's ok to bring a cat in the apartment.
Relax, she'll be fine.
Is there a Kitty out here? Kitty, Kitty! If it's a problem, I can just pawn him off on my dad.
Oh, no way.
I love cats.
They just do whatever they want to do.
Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Wow, Dee, if you could never do that again, that would be fantastic.
I'm a cat.
I don't care what you think.
Oh, my God.
How do you ever get laid? I'm waiting till I get married, like the Jonas brothers.
So, you're a virgin? Everywhere? Mm-hmm.
Of course.
Thank you.
That is amazing.
I think the first time you open your Pikachu, confetti comes out.
I think mine whistled.
He's so beautiful.
What's his name? Ass face.
Okey dokey, I'm gonna call him boots.
Oh, my God.
We're gonna have to get her laid.
No.
She is a rare and beautiful creature.
We need to keep her exactly the way she is and stuff her when she dies.
Oh, hey, Sloane.
Did you come to check out the new place? You know, we have Lamaze tonight, remember? You're about to become a terrible aunt.
Sloane, I'm sorry.
I thought Lamaze was tomorrow night.
Oh, that's so unusual.
Usually you're so protective of your brain cells.
Ha ha.
I'm supposed to work tonight.
But I could try to find someone to cover my shift.
Olivia, can you cover my shift?! No.
Well, that's out.
Well, this is ridiculous.
I mean, I have to go by myself? Sloane, come on.
It's the same thing every week.
It's just , push, plop, done.
Can I ask you a question? Have you ever considered about how you're gonna get me to the hospital? Uh, cab? Cabs can take up to a half an hour.
I know.
That's why everyone drives drunk.
You know, this isn't a joke to me.
This is me having a baby, ok? I need somebody I can count on, not somebody who's gonna siphon off my epidural.
Just stay home, then.
You don't even have to come to the hospital.
Come on, you need me.
Mom's gone, and Chris is in Afghanistan.
Well, I'll ask sister Mary Francis to come.
Sister Mary Francis? You're gonna have someone play catcher who's never even played with a bat before? Ok, good night, Chelsea.
Wait.
Are you seriously saying you'd rather have some old nun there than me? Yes.
At least she doesn't drink herself into jail on saturday nights.
That's because she has to work on sunday morning.
I can't believe Sloane doesn't want me at the birth of my own niece? I had so many good plans.
One thing I wanted to do was really scare the baby right when it came out.
That way, everything from there on out would be a piece of cake.
Simmer down, boots.
Ass face does not like to be held, Dee Dee.
He's mean.
Oh, no.
You're not mean.
Mmm.
Are those scratch marks on your neck? Yeah.
He's angry 'cause he can't talk.
Chelsea, I've been thinking about you and your sister.
You know, my mom and dad would fight and my dad and I would bake cupcakes for her.
Did that help? No.
She became a diabetic and ran off with her doctor.
Oh.
It's ok.
He's a really good doctor.
He caught it early, so she still has both her feet.
I just can't get past this Sloane thing.
I just keep grinding on it.
Maybe you should grind on something else.
Clear your head, get yourself back to normal.
It has been a while since my bottom half smiled.
There you go! Yeah.
What? That night I sent Olivia and Dee Dee to pizza hut and called Jonathan.
He came right over.
It was as if he was just sitting in front of the phone in a halfie.
I was kind of curious to be with my first redhead.
But while I had made peace with the drapes, I'd forgotten about the carpet.
Good lord! It was like a clown in a leg lock.
What's the matter? It's justYou got a lot going on down there.
I do? Yeah.
But it's cute.
It's like red Easter grass.
A little dense, though.
There could be bunnies in there.
What? Hey, I'm just kidding.
Hey, I know.
A little trim might make you more comfortable.
And I got scissors in here somewhere.
Now? Ohh.
I'm sorry, I gotta take this.
You know what, Chelsea? This is not working for me.
What? Wait! No, don't put your clothes on.
We can just turn off the light.
Good night, Chelsea.
Dad, this better be important.
I'm with Sloane at the hospital.
You gotta get down here.
-Sloane's in labor? -Yeah, and she's having a tough time.
Get it out of me! Ok, I'll, uh, I'll be right there.
I didn't care if we were in some stupid fight.
Over the years, whenever I got into trouble, Sloane was always there to bail me out.
So when that baby came bailing out of her, I wanted to be there to catch it.
Seriously, dad, I don't think this epidural is working.
Think of the pioneer women, sweetie.
All they could do was scream and bite on a rag.
Or die! Hi.
I know you said not to come to the hospital, but get your ass in here.
Sister Mary Francis is dead to me! Ok, one in, one out.
I think those are the rules.
I don't think I can do this, Chelsea.
Sloane, you can do this.
Girls at the prom do this all the time.
Just out of curiosity, what do you girls wear under that getup? Buy me a pack of smokes and I'll tell you.
Oh, look at her.
She is fantastic.
I know.
I'm so crazy about her already.
Let's see how you feel when you see what she did to your entertainment center.
Have you decided on a name yet? Yes.
I'm gonna name her after mom.
Sylvia, huh? Well, that's our mother's name, yeah.
Sylvia.
Dad's gonna love that.
He's such a kiss-ass.
I know.
I know you hate when I say goopy stuff to you, but I have to tell you that I don't think I could have done this without you.
I really mean it.
Thank you.
Just for the record, you pooped a little when you were pushing.
I know.
I did that for you.
Have a cigar.
Sir, cigar.
Chels, congratulations.
Thanks.
Yeah, you finally have someone to call baby who's not on top of you.
You mean underneath me.
Dee Dee, have a cigar.
Oh, no, thank you.
Then at least do your shot.
It smells like oven cleaner.
Just close your eyes and down it or else you hate the baby.
Oh Oh, I think my ears popped.
The dance floor is now open! Hey, Chels, where's the camera? It's right there.
All right, everybody, if you would be so kind as to turn your attention to our monitors Aaahhhh! Whoa! Huh.
That's my bad.
Well, I promised vodka I would turn my life around, and two weeks later I have a new apartment and I have a new niece who I helped bring into the world.
Trying to trim a redhead ridiculous.
But as far as relationships go, you never know what fate might put in your path.

6,Animal Practice,"Giggles? Giggles, where are you? The Wendy Williams show is starting.
Giggles! Wendy and Jessica Simpson are swapping wigs.
Giggles? Giggles, no! Owners' names are Trudy and Roger Watts.
Giggles has been a patient for a year.
No wedding ring, tattered bathrobe, elastic jeans, snap socks.
Looks like Roger's no longer in the picture.
I'll handle this.
Good news, Ms.
Watts, Giggles is going to be just fine.
Oh, it's a miracle.
Actually, it's a phenomenon called ""high rise syndrome.
"" Cats that fall instinctively twist their bodies into a riding reflex, but I believe what Giggles did was more likely a cry for help.
Are you saying my cat tried to-- Tried to commit suicide? Yes.
I believe she's trying to tell you something.
Like what? Giggles is very happy.
Your cat's in heat.
Set her free.
Let her meet someone that's gonna grab her by the scruff of her neck and make her purr so loud that the neighbors will complain.
What'd you say your name was? My name's Dr.
George Coleman And I get off at 6:00.
Come on, Phil Collins, come on.
He's falling behind, George.
I personally gave that horse his last exam.
- Phil is a winner.
- Guys, guys! Come on, I'm in the middle of this.
- Shut up, Doug.
- Seriously, go somewhere else, - you're gonna jinx us.
- Why am I the one over here expressing glands, and you guys are over there, bettin' on the ponies? Well, you're sort of betting too.
- Excuse me? - Remember you loaned me money to build a gazebo? Oh, man.
Come-- That was gazebo money, Yamamoto.
My wife's in charge of my checking account, all right? - She doesn't like gambling! - So then don't gamble.
Tell your wife to eat it, Yamamoto.
I can't.
She's so emasculating.
I'd tell her to stop, but a part of me likes it.
- It's so complicated.
- Guys, look at that.
- Phil's making his move.
- All right, okay, that's it.
- Phil's making his move.
- Let's go, Phil.
You beautiful son of a bitch, make me some money! Come on! - There he goes.
- Have y'all seen Dr.
Coleman? Oh, Dr.
Yamamoto, get the blinds.
Dr.
Rizzo, get the door.
Come on, now.
Come on, now.
Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.
- Come on, now! - Only one working around here? - Come on, come on, come on! - Come on, go, go, go! Get it, get it! Yes! - I won some money.
- I'm gonna get so drunk.
Everybody back to work! This is a animal hospital, not Chuck E.
Cheese.
- Mm-hmm.
That's what I said.
- Yeah.
Come on, guys.
Did you know chickens can run up to 9 miles an hour? Did you know we're running four hours behind? There's order in my disorder, Juanita.
Oh, speaking of disorder, there's a woman in the waiting room, wants to see you, and she doesn't even have a pet.
I will look into it.
- Oh, Dr.
Coleman-- - Good morning, hi.
- Dr.
Coleman.
- Hi, how are you? Please wait your turn.
I believe this yoga enthusiast is next.
Surprise.
Dorothy.
I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother.
As far as people go, Eleanor Crane wasn't so bad.
Thank you.
She thought the world of you.
Hey, Rizzo.
Did you get a haircut? Don't suck up to the monkey.
Okay, George, uh, we need to talk.
I was expecting this.
Two years ago, you walked out on our relationship without any explanation, so now you're here to apologize? That's not exactly how I remember it.
- Apology accepted.
- George-- Although, in my mind, when we had this conversation, that skirt was right over there on that table.
George, my grandmother left me the hospital.
You don't know the first thing about running a hospital.
Why would she leave it to you? Well, because I promised her that I'd pour my soul into this place.
That's stupid.
Are you sure this isn't just an elaborate ploy to get back in my pants? It's not really hard to get into your pants.
I'll give you that.
I have been running up and down these halls since I was a little girl, okay? And I know that I can improve things here, starting with that mess of a waiting room.
Come on, follow me.
Not gonna follow you.
Hey, hey, I've won three canine awards and a Mountain Dew meow.
I built this place into the top animal hospital in the country.
Yes, but it could be so much better.
- Name one thing.
- For starters, maybe start caring about the owners.
There's been a man waiting out there for three days.
That is-- that-- that is a long time.
You are an incredible vet but a lousy director.
My system may not be perfect, but I help a lot of animals, and I meet a lot of girls.
My system is perfect.
I'm not gonna sit around and let you turn my grandmother's legacy into a zoo.
Really? What? He's doin' his rounds.
Wowie.
Dorothy Crane back in your life, huh? Can't believe it.
I can't believe how fat she got.
You wish.
She looks fantastic.
Don't get used to it.
She'll be gone in a week.
I don't know, George.
I always kinda had a feeling that you two were gonna end up together.
Monogamy is unnatural.
Of all the species on this planet, only 20 mate for l-- You know who mates for life? - Termites.
- Termites.
Yeah, you told me that before.
Hey, can I talk to you as a friend? I'm not keen on being friends.
Can I talk to you as somebody who's worked with you for the better part of a decade? Even that makes me uncomfortable.
George, my girlfriend left me for Dr.
Shankar.
Dr.
Shankar? That guy's a good catch.
Come on, man.
I'm being serious.
Dominance hierarchies occur in most animal species that live in groups, including primates, Doug.
You lost your place in the food chain.
I'm not a primate.
I live in Brooklyn.
I get my food from FreshDirect.
I have opposable thumbs.
You got to show her you're still the Alpha male.
What would Harvey do? Confront Shankar, establish dominance.
Like, you want me to kill him? And we all sing oh, well, I never! was there ever a cat so clever as magical Mr.
Mistoffelees? oh, well, I never! Dorothy said we would rotate our favorite music.
Are we even open? Where are all the patients? Already being helped.
We're ahead of schedule, so-- Mistoffelees oh, well, I-- - Good morning.
- You're still here? Look, George, I know that working together may be a little awkward at first or very awkward forever, but the important thing is is that we both love this place, so we can learn from each other.
- You can learn from me.
- And you me.
- Just you me.
- Okay, fine.
I'll learn from you, which is why I will be joining you on your rounds this morning.
Okay.
Great.
You are gonna be really glad that I'm here, George.
I can tell, I can really feel it.
Walk away if you agree! Oh, yeah.
You agree.
Mr.
Waxman, Lily, good news.
Honey's going to be okay.
She just ate something that needs to be removed.
Thank you, Dr.
Coleman.
Sweetie, why don't you give honey to the nice lady? The grown-ups have to talk.
Figures.
All this thing does is eat my stuff.
What's this gonna cost? - Surgery's $2,000.
- 2 grand? I could buy, like, six dogs that wouldn't piss me off for 2 grand.
I don't want to pay that.
What you want doesn't matter.
When you brought this dog into your home, you signed an unwritten contract to feed it, care for it, and, yes, provide medical care if need be.
Okay, look, if money is an issue, we can-- Hold on, I'm on a roll! Now, you're gonna pay this money, I'm gonna operate.
If you have a problem with that, then next time, don't leave your crap lying around.
I don't like your tone.
- Mm, I don't care.
- Okay, then.
How much to kill the thing? Whoa.
You don't mean that.
Sorry, I mean, uh, ""put it to sleep.
"" Look, you're not putting her to sleep.
Okay, let's ""put it down"" then? I'm starting to get annoyed with your air quotes.
I find them quite useful, like when referring to - a veterinarian as a ""doctor.
"" - Okay, Mr.
Waxman-- Save your breath.
Don't you see that his premature balding and feminine hands indicate masculinity issues, not unlike a dog who barks with no bite.
- I'm taking this animal.
- What? No, hey! That is not your dog.
- Give me my dog back! - Rizzo, run some interference.
George! What the hell? George, what are you doing? If we have any chance of saving this dog, we have to reason with that guy.
People are incapable of reason.
Why do you think they keep eating at Arby's? Oh, only you eat at Arby's! You still won't admit that arby's is delicious! Ow.
Hey! Don't.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa! All right, we tried things your way, and now we go back to mine.
Hey, Rizzo, scrub in.
Rizzo is not scrubbing in.
Smooch him.
Smooch him.
What? Am I the only one who can sense the sexy tension? Has anyone seen Dr.
Coleman? About this high, emotionally unavailable? George, does having this new director mean I gotta take another drug test? Not a good time, Angela.
Because I passed the first one fair and square.
It's like a double jeopardy situation, and Frank agrees.
Who's Frank? My parole officer.
You call your parole officer by his first name? Well, yeah.
Once we started doing it, ""Officer Kalinowski"" was just a mouthful.
- Excuse me.
- Ms.
Crane, I am not peeing in a cup unless it's for money - or love.
- Okay.
Well, thank you, Angela.
That's good to know.
Mm-hmm.
George, where did you hide Waxman's dog? I can't tell you that.
Doctor-patient confidentiality.
Aha! So you admit that you hid him.
You don't get to ""aha"" about that.
I basically just told you.
Bengal tiger giving birth! There were complications at the zoo! Give her two ccs of ketamine and one cc of medetomidine! Juanita, get my scrubs! Why wasn't I notified? Because Dr.
Jackson and Dr.
Yamamoto - are gonna handle this.
- No, no! My guys answer to me, not you.
Whoa! Guys, stand down.
Sorry, George, I'm a bad man.
I'm not sorry.
This is goin' on the highlight reel.
Traitors! This is not working for me.
Tell me where Waxman's dog is.
Fine, fine, you win.
Dr.
Wong's office.
- Thank you, George.
- You're welcome.
George, there's no Dr.
Wong here, is there? No, there is not.
Deception.
Keepin' it sexy.
Yeah.
I gotta go clean this guy's butt.
- There you go.
- Okay, watch their heart rates and keep 'em stimulated, all right? - Thank you.
- Everybody out.
Everybody out, except for you two.
I'm so sorry, George.
I am so sorry! Save it, Yamamoto.
That's your second strike.
What was my first strike? When did we get on a strike system? And covering my morning shifts for the next month - is not gonna make it up to me.
- Then I'll cover two months.
Make it four, and then I'll let you buy me dinner.
Thank you so much, George, but not tomorrow night 'cause Doug and I have dinner with Dorothy.
N- not the Dorothy that you know, we know an African-American Dorothy.
Good one.
Why are you having dinner with Dorothy? Frankly, it's none of your business.
Yamamoto, tell me everything.
Doug had coffee with her this morning.
There might have been a Danish involved.
- He wanted romantic love advice.
- Oh.
I am so sorry.
I'm a coward, and you know that.
Dorothy thinks, and I-- I happen to agree that I just-- I need some time to heal myself emotionally.
I gave you all the advice you need.
Yeah, and your advice sucked.
I confronted Dr.
Shankar, just like you told me to, in front of my girlfriend, and he kicked my ass.
And his girlfriend saw everything.
It was so humiliating.
So she wasn't even a little bit turned on? No, in fact, there's a restraining order filed against me now, and I have to stay at least 50 yards away from her at all times.
You need to move on.
It's time to wrestle with another gazelle.
I am not a gazelle.
I'm not a termite! I'm going to get you laid.
- Okay.
- All right, let's go.
Yeah.
We're gonna learn a lot today.
- Okay, good.
- A woman's dog will tell you everything you need to know about her.
Right there, brunette with the terrier.
Now, that's a rarified breed.
Very well-trained, definitely out of your league.
- Okay.
- Redhead with the dachshund? Skip it.
I spy a closet racist.
That's a sexy racist.
Babe with the great Dane? The great Dane is the Subaru of dogs.
That woman is a lesbian.
You're just talkin' out of your ass.
You can't know that.
That's her sister.
All right, what about-- Okay, look, these two.
All right.
Two young ladies and their pugs, carefree, vivacious, ready to party.
Dwayne, go break the ice.
Yeah.
That's a good boy.
Oh, hey.
There's my special guy.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- You know, I don't think that we have ever seen two pugs as adorable as yours.
No, and-- and we're veterinarians.
You know, we've seen our share of good-looking pugs.
This adorable pug's my everything.
That's cute.
Hopefully not everything.
- What do you mean? - I mean, just-- Generally speaking, you know, pugs have a short lifespan.
- That's not true.
- You're saying he's gonna die soon? - No.
- No.
- No.
- No, that's-- no.
No, no.
Not what I'm saying.
That is-- What I'm saying is, judging from the paw size on that guy-- He's a very healthy dog.
He is gonna live to be at least eight.
But he's already ten.
- Look at that.
- Is he? Every day's a gift.
- Who's thirsty? - Me.
I'm gonna throw up.
Ah! This is why I'm not keen on friends.
Oh, good.
George, tap me out! - No, you're doin' great.
- I'm losing, George.
Hey, George, can I have a word with you? Huh? Yeah, I got a minute.
Very funny, Yamamoto.
I'm losing, George! I need help.
- So I talked to Waxman - Mm.
And he just wants one thing, whole mess goes away.
Great, happy to do it.
You're not gonna be happy to do it.
- You don't know me.
- I do.
No, I've changed.
Whole new person.
He wants you to apologize.
- No, absolutely not.
- George, seriously! Work with me here.
I don't work with people.
This is my hospital.
I'm not going halfsies, so please disappear the way that you did last time.
- What are you saying? - Two years ago, I leave to go pick us up some thai food, when I get back, you're gone.
No explanation.
And do you remember what I said to you before you went to go get that thai food? ""I want Tom Yum Goong.
"" I told you I loved you, and do you remember what you said back to me? ""Awesome.
"" I told you I loved you, and you said, ""awesome.
"" You know what? This little experiment of us working together is goin' bust, so if you're not leaving, then I will.
- You're not leaving.
- I am leaving.
I quit.
- George, don't do this.
- Watch me.
Fine.
I guess you get to be the one who leaves now.
Hey, George, if you're done over there, can you help me out? Don't forget jaws.
I told myself I wasn't gonna cry.
I lied to myself.
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
He's fine, okay? He's probably got offers from, like, five different hospitals already.
You're a really bad lady.
- You're worse than my wife.
- Oh.
But you're still sexy.
He's a riddle.
I- I-- Waxman called.
He's gonna be here in an hour, and he's threatening to call the police.
I can't fix anything until I find the dog.
Do you-- do you have any idea of where George would hide the dog? No.
But I got a feeling I know who does.
Sorry, Ms.
Crane, but we have a fifth amendment situation on our hands, and you're gonna have to talk to my attorney, but good luck with that, 'cause he's in Rikers, doing five to sev-- - I'll give you Columbus Day off.
Throw in Arbor Day, and we have a deal.
- Done.
- One missing yorkie, comin' right up.
George sure had you running in circles, didn't he? Yeah, wouldn't be the first time.
You know, not all dogs go to heaven.
Sometimes they just end up in the ground.
Uh, I'll-- I'll just take the next one.
No, no, no.
Come on in, it's your elevator now.
Rizzo, make room.
Okay.
Thanks, Rizzo.
You're such a gentleman.
- Goin' home early? - Yeah.
Yeah, it's been a hard day.
Mm-hmm.
Ten years of being here, everything I have fits in this box.
You know I didn't want it this way.
No, no.
I'm glad.
I'm going on vacation.
Rizzo's always wanted to learn how to water-ski, so-- - How's it going with Waxman? - Great.
Great.
Got it all under control.
Then why is your purse barking? I was gonna pose as her owner and take her to another animal hospital.
- Interesting.
- What am I supposed to do? Okay? She needs the surgery, and I don't want any doctors here getting into trouble.
If only you knew a doctor here who's not a doctor here.
Okay.
You believe that miscreant wanted to put this beautiful dog to sleep? Wonder why I'm not a fan of most people.
One day you're gonna have to accept the fact that you're part of the human race.
Are we really that bad? - Hold this right here.
- Right here? - Yup.
- Okay.
- Don't move.
- Just like that? Whoa.
- What'd you do? - What? No, what? - I didn't do anything.
- What did you do? You did.
- No, you did something.
- I just did what you told me to do.
I haven't even moved it.
Just kidding.
Oh.
Well, Mr.
Waxman, I guess you are what your dog eats.
Honey! Oh, easy, Lily.
Honey's had a rough day.
You kidnap my dog and then perform surgery? Yes, I did.
You can pay on your way out.
You better lawyer up 'cause I'm gonna sue you and you - and the monkey! - Dr.
Coleman, will you please show Mr.
Waxman what you removed from Honey's stomach? I believe this is a coaster from Dazzles.
- Dazzles is a strip club.
- Yeah.
Big scoop, divorced man frequents strip club.
So what? Here's what.
Your little girl's gonna grow up and one day figure out that her father, who she trusted and loved, killed her dog because she ate a coaster from a strip club, and this is gonna fill her with such anger towards you, that in ten years, you're gonna walk into Dazzles, and find that swinging from a pole is none other than your little girl.
And you know what name I bet she's gonna go by? Honey! We accept all major credit cards.
That felt awesome.
See, ""awesome"" is not that bad a word.
Good luck with this place, Dorothy.
Hey, I would, uh, tell you that I am sad to see you leave, but that would probably just make you uncomfortable, right? It's already making me uncomfortable.
Exactly.
That is why I'm here to tell you something that I know you will appreciate.
You will never guess what happened to me last night.
You took home a curvaceous redhead who attacked you with a sexual ferocity you've never known before.
Yeah.
Wha-- ? That was a shockingly accurate guess.
That's, uh, eh, like, you got me a hooker.
You got me a hooker.
I didn't get you a hooker.
I may have mentioned the name of your favorite bar to Dr.
Shankar's ex-girlfriend, who also did not appreciate getting dumped.
Really? You made that happen? You bet.
As any Siberian tiger will illustrate, revenge is a subhuman instinct.
Siberian tigers will spend weeks hunting and killing anything that's harmed them.
Humans call this an anger bang or a grudge f-- Yes! Yes, I heard that one before.
I told you, George, didn't I? You are a friend.
Hey, Doug, uh, can I get a second with George? Oh, I guess so.
Please unpack your box.
At the end of the day, it's about the animals, and nobody knows animals like George Coleman.
Come on, Dorothy.
Too much history for us both to be here.
I don't believe that, and I'd like to think that you don't either.
I hope I see you tomorrow, George.
Oh.
Taxi! Hey! What? I should've said it.
I should've told you how I felt two years ago.
Wow, George.
You may actually have a heart in there.
Heart's just a muscle, Dorothy, nothing more.
If I'm gonna romanticize an organ, it certainly won't be that one.
So this is gonna be okay? You tried to sneak a dog out in your purse today to save it.
That is impetuous and stupid.
That was like something I would've done.
Want to get a drink? I don't think so.
Come on, just a drink.
No, it's never just a drink with us.
I know, that's why I like drinking with you.
Good night, George.
I was listening the whole time, George, and she wants it.
I mean, like, she wants to do the horizontal hula, and by, like, the horizontal hula, I mean she wants you to put your bread into her basket.
Yeah, no, I got you.
Hey, you still want to get that drink? Yeah, I don't know.
Got some beers I took from some kids.
Told 'em I was a cop.
Idiots.
Hey, have you seen Dr.
Coleman? George? Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
You weren't interrupting.
We're just inspecting the fractured femur of a St.
Bernard - that came in yesterday.
- Oh.
Well, I'm glad to hear things are running so smoothly.
- Go! Go! Go! - Yes! - Oh, no! - Come on! Come on! - Yes! - Yeah! Boom! Yeah! - Still goin'! - I told you.
- Pay up, Riz.
- Pay him, monkey.
Come on, monkey, pay up.
All of it.
All of it.
Thank you.
Eat it, Rizzo.",fail
7,Mulaney,"Growing up is weird, though.
Like I'm 30 now, and I have this new phenomenon in my life where, late at night, when I'm on the street, women will look at me like I'm a threat.
Yeah, that is funny.
It's also weird, because I'm still afraid of being kidnapped.
But once, I walking towards the subway at 2:00 in the morning Walking towards the subway, and there was this woman in front of me, and she was walking along, but she kept giving me, like, the ""over the shoulder,"" like that.
And then she started to walk a lot faster.
So I thought, oh, she must hear the train coming.
Or maybe she feels it in her feet like a native American in a movie.
So I started to sprint towards the subway at her, and she looked back and she was like, ""aah!"" And then she gives chase, so now we're booking it towards the subway at 2:00 in the morning, and I'm gaining on her.
And I'm gaining on her, and we're getting to the end of the subway hallway, and she goes into that ""dead end shuffle,"" you know, that women do when you chase 'em, and I'm almost at her.
I'm almost at her, and then it dawns on me, ""oh, she's running from me, because in her eyes, I'm an adult.
And adults murder each other.
"" So I wanted to go up to her and be like, ""Hey, no, I'm not a man.
"" But I think that that would be equally creepy Is if you were in a subway at 2:00 in the morning and I chased you down, grabbed you and said, ""I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm a little boy.
"" SO1EO1 Pilot Mulaney is filmed in front of a live studio audience, okay? Thanks for coming with me, Motif.
It's no problem, I was free.
Hey, can I be your emergency contact? Yeah, I mean, I normally put my mom, but I guess we're roommates.
Let's do it.
It's also good promotion for me.
Matter of fact, don't put my phone number down, put down on my web site: Oh, and write down they should skip my intro.
Yeah.
All right.
Why am I at the doctor? Oh, ""frequent urination.
"" That's a good fake reason.
I thought you wanted to ask the doctor for Xanax.
Well, I do, but I can't just come right out and ask a doctor for Xanax, Motif.
Looks shady when you're honest with doctors.
I need to make up a reason to be here and then let the doctor check me out and then when he's done I say offhandedly, ""oh, and you know what? Sometimes I get nervous on airplanes.
"" Bam, Xanax.
What do you need Xanax for anyway? I'm anxious all the time, like, in every situation.
Like, I've noticed lately, this is my regular speaking voice.
- Mm-hmm.
- I go into a whole different speaking voice when I'm in a public bathroom and someone suddenly knocks on the door, and that voice is, ""Someone's in here! Someone's in here!"" As if they're gonna be like, ""oh, I think there's a carnival barker in there.
I think someone's trying to drum up business for a carnival.
"" Plus today, I have a meeting with Lou Cannon.
- That's right! TV's Lou Cannon.
- TV's Lou Cannon.
You get a job with him writing, you're set! That dude is so talented, he's rich! Yeah, all the more reason to be anxious.
Oh, did I tell you about this new joke I wrote? - What's the joke? - Okay, okay, okay.
It's about like how there's, like, women But then, there are, like, problem bitches.
Is there more? - That's all I have so far.
- All right.
I am not crazy! Hi, Jane.
Why are you walking into rooms yelling, ""I am not crazy?"" It's not fair, okay? When a guy wants to destroy a woman, all he has to do is call her crazy, even if she has every right to be angry.
Hey, men get called crazy too.
Yeah, but people like it when a man's crazy.
We have recordings of Christian Bale screaming like a lunatic, and people are impressed.
They're like, ""oh, my God, he's so passionate about his process.
"" Meanwhile there is a rumor that Katherine Heigl is difficult, and she's, like, dead.
So who called you crazy, Janey? Dustin emailed that new girl he's dating and was like, ""my ex-girlfriend is crazy.
"" And how did you see that email? He should change - His password.
- Oh, my God.
You have got to stop that stuff.
You're gonna get caught.
It's so irresponsible.
Now then, I have to go lie to this doctor so that I am drugged-up enough for my job interview.
I'll be back.
So, Mr.
Mulaney, how many times a day are you urinating? Oh.
Um Crazy, right? But what can you do? Anyway, Doctor, sometimes, on airplanes, I've been W-wait, hold on, you're urinating 11 times a day? Was that too many times to say? Sounds like the problem could be in your prostate.
Do me a favor, come over here Drop your pants.
Oh, this isn't what I thought.
I should probably get going.
I have a job interview.
Mr.
Mulaney, you are peeing an alarming number of times a day.
There is no way you're leaving here without a prostate exam.
Oh, not on your hands, on your elbows.
- Oh, I - There we go.
I liked the way I was standing before, actually.
It had more dignity to it.
All right, now, you're going to feel a little pressure.
I guess this might as well happen.
Adult life is so weird.
Oh, and doctor, sometimes I get nervous on O-o-ohh! You let the Doctor do what? Never mind.
You wouldn't understand.
No, I wouldn't.
I don't let people put things in me.
All right, look, what floor is Lou Cannon on? - 25th floor penthouse.
- Thank you.
And now here's your host.
You guessed it, Lou Cannon! Thank you! Thank you! You're very kind, and right.
Confidence, confidence, elegance under fire.
- Hello? - One second.
You're all here, even the young people.
""Hashtag.

We have a meeting today about writing for your show.
- Oh, Donna? - Yes, Lou? Do I have a meeting with a ""Jay Mulaylay?"" Yes, he's the comedian that's on the Internet.
Oh, that one.
And do you write all those little mean things below? No, those are my fans.
Ah.
You're a messy little person, ain't ya? I'm sorry, I am kind of a mess today, I The subway was running late, then when I got off, on the sidewalk, there was a wheelchair just knocked over on its side with no one in it.
That's a bad thing to see.
Something happened there.
You hope it was a miracle But probably not.
Hey, finally throwing out your ex-boyfriend's stuff.
I'm proud of you, girl.
Well, I was going to burn it, but that would be too romantic.
When did he leave this stuff? You always stayed over there.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is stuff I took from him, you know, to make him a better, less embarrassing person.
A person the new girlfriend gets to enjoy while I get no credit.
I mean, look at this.
A hoodie vest? A statue of Buddha? I'm sorry, you're from Maryland and you yell at video games, you're not a Buddhist.
Okay, okay, okay, let's just show some respect, please.
This hoodie vest is tight.
Now if I could only un-remember his email password.
""Guyritchie5.

Ah, I got something too.
I will pry it out of you.
- Try me.
- I'll show you my butt.
That's the password! Johnny Do people call you ""Johnny""? 'Cause they shouldn't.
John I'm gonna make a speech, and I want you to listen to me.
I am 45 years old.
And I have an Emmy award, and when you put it against to this mirror, it looks like I have two Emmy awards.
Two Emmys and a Daytime Tony.
Now, John, I can show you how to get where I am, that is, if you're ready to learn.
Honestly, Mr.
Cannon, I have been very anxious lately that I'm almost 30 and I've never had a real job in comedy, and if you give me the chance to work for you, sir, I promise I can do an excellent job.
Aw.
That sincerity will take you right to the middle.
Donna, he's hired.
Mazel Tov.
Now, listen, I have a benefit next Wednesday.
Maybe you can help me with it and be my opening act.
Open for you? Oh, my God, are you serious? That would be incredible.
Yeah, yeah, it'd be a big deal for you.
Yeah.
It's for the Marsha Foundation.
It's a breast cancer walk I founded.
I named it after my hairdresser, Marsha.
Oh oh, I'm sorry.
Did she pass away? No, she wasn't even sick.
I just thought she'd get a kick out of it.
Hey! Guess who's working for Lou Cannon? You got the job? Young mula! - Come here, man.
- Yeah.
Aw! All right.
Yeah, it's really cool.
I can finally tell my parents that my jokes are gonna be on TV.
Hey, did you mention my name? Oh, of course, we talked about you the whole time.
Mulaney, that old guy from across the hall, he came by looking for you.
Oh, Oscar, that's right.
I'm supposed to fill his humidifiers.
He has one in the bedroom and one in the living room, and they're really deep, so you have to fill them up in the bathtub.
God, we're all just gonna die one day.
Anyway, I'm sure he'll understand you're busy now.
Yeah, speaking of, Motif, can you help me out? I was supposed to do a spot on that Hudson River Cruise Show next week, but now I gotta work for Lou.
Can you fill in for me? 75 bucks.
Yeah, no problem, man.
It'll give me a chance to sell my new t-shirts.
Bah! ""Problem bitch.
"" Like the joke you haven't written yet? No doubt.
I have bad news, guys.
It's Andre.
It's Andre.
Why is he here? I can't just stop by without telling you? No, that is not how drug dealers work.
- What's her problem? - Oh, she's just going through a break-up.
Also, you're very unpleasant.
Jane, you are single? - Too close.
- Okay.
You know, I don't plan on selling weed forever.
As soon as my grandma dies and my parents die, I'm coming into quite a bit of money.
Jane, you should have Andre change Dustin's email password.
Good idea, because then, if I want to find out what it is, I'll have to talk to Andre, - which I'd never do.
- Which you'd never do.
John Mulaney, where do you come from? What's your background? Do you have family, siblings? I actually have two sisters.
They live back in Chicago with my mom and my It's a yes or no question.
Come on, let's get to work.
Absolutely.
I know you have a taping today.
I stayed up last night and wrote a lot of jokes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Normally, I don't work with writers, so I think first you have to learn how to write for my voice, okay? Like, I'm very smart, but it doesn't mean I can't be silly.
I like fast, fast, fast setups and slow punch lines.
Like, a good joke for me would be ""Bwah, bwah.
"" Like, there's a joke I did in my one-man show, ""Divorce and other aphrodisiacs.
"" - Did you ever see it? - I'm sorry, I didn't, actually.
Okay, good, well, I'll perform it from the beginning for you.
Black stage, spot on me.
By the time I hit puberty, I knew I was in trouble.
The year, 1982.
- The city, Duluth.
- _ ""you did good, kid.
I think you're going places,"" the club owner said to me.
All I could do is smile.
Blackout, end of show.
Okay, so you go on in three minutes.
Do you want to read my jokes? Oh John, I don't need you to write jokes for me, I really don't.
- Then what am I doing here? - Oh, that's funny.
""What am I doing here?"" I'll use that.
Hey, we're really vibing, huh? And if it wasn't for me, you'd be stuck bombing on that cruise show tonight.
See, everyone knows a problem bitch.
If you don't know one, then you are the problem bitch.
Yeah, I never write anything.
Lou just talks at me for hours.
It's like he's trying to torture me and I'm his best friend.
Oh, I miss my sorority.
Well, at least you're getting to open for him - at this ""Marsha"" thing.
- Yeah, it is a big show.
What are you doing here, by the way, 'cause I know it's not to support me.
I know, right? No, Dustin lives on this street.
- Ugh! - No, no, no, it's good, John.
I came here to get closure.
You know, let him see that I've moved on.
I'm doing a walk-a-thon.
I mean, would a woman with nothing in her life immerse herself in charity work? Eh, maybe she would.
Yeah.
All right, I'm gonna walk by his window one last time.
Have fun.
-Hello? - John, it's Donna, Lou Cannon's assistant.
- Hi, Donna, how are you? - Blessed.
So Lou has a special announcement he wants you to read to get the crowd warmed up.
No problem.
All right, everybody.
Who's ready to laugh? Yeah! I can't hear you.
That's not true, of course, but cheer louder.
Yeah.

Hey, Lou.
- What's with the dirt? - I yanked these flowers - out of Dustin's window box.
- What? I planted them last year.
He and his new girlfriend think they get to enjoy them? Uh, yeah, no.
They're mine! - Jane, I thought you wanted closure.
- I wanted justice, white boy, and I am one step closer.
- Oh, my God, Dustin's home.
- Oh, God.
I gotta hit the bricks.
Oh scatter! Hey, I need that lapel mic back.
I can't remember the last time I've been this humiliated.
- Undo your belt a little and bend over.
- Sure thing.
Not on your hands, on your elbows.
Now I can remember.
I'm sorry Lou canceled on you, man.
I'm having a rough week too.
I sold out of my ""problem bitch"" t-shirts.
You sold 150 t-shirts that say ""problem bitch""? It was that cruise.
I knew my jokes could conquer land but sea? So what's wrong? I don't have an ending for that joke yet.
""Problem bitch"" is out there in the Zeitgeist now, and I figure I have an 18-hour window before people realize they're laughing at nothing.
You guys.
You guys, listen to this email Dustin sent his new girlfriend.
Bad news.
"" Ah! Okay.
""So, psycho"" That's me.
""Showed up today and ripped out the flowers she planted.
"" That I planted.

Listen.
New girl writes back and says he should call the cops.
He says, and I quote, ""relax.

Then he writes, ""do you know what you are? ""A problem bitch.
I almost miss Jane, because crazy calms down, but a problem bitch is forever.
"" - My joke has an ending! - And I have closure! - Life is okay! Come here! - We did it! Hello.
How did you even read that email? I thought that Andre had the password.
He did.
Oh, yuck.
But then she begged me for it, John.
She said she'd do anything, and I said, ""very well, let me hang out at your apartment.
"" Oh, I should have asked for more.
Hello, Donna.
No, don't worry, you're not on speaker.
Oh, you prefer to be? Okay.
Hi, John.
Lou wants to see you.
He has another job for you.
Oh, what happened? Did cardboard Lou kill an escort? I know it's hard, John.
I was a writer too before I got promoted.
I'm not confident now.
I was confident when I was a kid.
Like, I'm straight, but I was definitely gay when I was a little boy.
A lot of little boys are gay.
You know, they're very flowy and they have strong opinions on things.
I don't mean that I was a sexually active gay man when I was a child, that's not what I'm saying.
I was more like a 70-year-old gay man who's kind of over it sexually, you know? I was like an old Queen.
Like, I would go out to recess and be like, ""everyone get outta my way.
I just wanna sit here and feed my birds.
"" The gym teacher would tell me to play kick ball, and I'd be like, ""you want me to do what?"" - Oh, hello.
- Hi, Oscar.
I'm giving the fern a time-out.
He's being a real diva today.
You don't look so good.
Come in and have some tea.
Oh, Oscar, I'd love to, but I have to get back to my dream job.
Nonsense, come in for tea.
I pay $80 a month for this apartment, and I want people to enjoy it.
Thanks.
Wait, you pay $80 a month? I know.
So what's this new job? Oh, I'm writing for this big comedian now.
Do you know Lou Cannon? Is he the one that's Jon Stewart? - No.
- I love Jon Stewart.
Yeah.
So how's the job? Honestly, Oscar, it's bad.
I thought that working for Lou was gonna change things for me, but so far, the whole experience has been pointless.
Mm.
I don't like that.
Let me show you something.
Have some tea.
See this Turkish tea tray? I got it on a business trip during my Wall Street days.
I didn't know that you worked on Wall Street.
That's where my bicycle shop was.
Anyway, I went to Turkey to cut a deal for some banana seat covers.
Turns out the dealer was a crook! But while I was there, I found this amazing tea tray.
Do you fully see what I mean? Not really, but you talking is very relaxing.
Well, I'll never regret my trip to Turkey because I got something valuable out of it.
Now, this job of yours may be a drag, but you have to find out if there's a tea tray in it for you.
But what if I can't find a tea tray? Then quit.
And when you quit, make a scene.
Every time I quit a job, they had to call the cops.
I adore cops.
Just airbrush under the eyes and neck.
I want to keep it natural.
There you go.
Thanks, see you later.
Lou.
Oh, good, you are here.
We need a stand-in for the rehearsal.
The male stand-in is late.
Just go over there and act masculine.
I'm not gonna be a stand-in.
I'm a writer.
And we need to talk about this.
I need to know if there's anything in this job for me.
Well, let's hash it out.
Rehearsal's up.
But since we're in rehearsal, Lofty, can you put John there, and I'm gonna stand, um I'll stand here, right there.
There.
Now, don't be afraid to speak your mind.
This is how you want to talk? I very much prefer it.
Okay, Lou, I have worked for you for one week, and so far, all I've done is stay up until 6:00 A.
M.
every night, watching you eat pudding and riff.
I never get to do standup.
What's in this job for me? For the answer, let's go to Dean Cain.
I answered ""B.
"" Photosynthesis.
Yo-o-o-o-ou guessed it! Oh, there's nothing here for me.
Good-bye, Lou.
Wait, John, don't storm out like a little Bat Mitzvah girl.
- I want you to proof those cue cards.
- What? Wait a second, are these my jokes? The ones I wrote for you? Well, you wrote them, but then I'm gonna put my own spin on them and then say them.
You're gonna say jokes that I wrote on TV? I know where this is going.
Yes, you're gonna get paid.
I just, um Franco? Money Cannon, one blast.
Whoa, a hundred bucks! A hundred bucks? No, that's not right.
Here you go, 20, perfect.
All right, thanks.
So will I see you tomorrow? Yes, you will, Lou, because I got my tea tray.
Ha ha! That is so tea tray.
You're gonna go far, little one, but it's a tough, tough business.
There are ups and there are downs.

- Oh! What a relief.
Oh, God, I cannot tell you how hard it's been for me to think about my divorced, you know, much older sister living all alone.
You know, it's this kind of sadness that never leaves you.
Okay, let's stay focused here, all right? This is about me.
I am just saying I haven't had a date in I don't know how many years.
I mean, last time I went out with someone, I had this elaborate, feathered-back hairdo.
- I've still got it.
Huh? - You sure do.
(Sighs) Okay, I'm a little freaked out.
Nobody has seen this in a very long time.
Well, I hope it still works.
I just saw this thing on animal planet about the anteater world, and after ten months (Makes sucking sound) It just seals right back up.
Oh, my (Cell phone rings) (Ring) Ooh, it's Annie.
Shh! Shh! Shh! Hush! Nobody's talking.
(Ring) Hi, honey.
No, I'm still at work.
Yeah, totally at work.
Hey, I'll slide that P.

P.
, boss! Oh, look, I'm swamped.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I gotta go.
Okay, sweet dreams.
Jane, that was a complete lie.
You know, I mean, sometimes you have to lie to protect them from the fact that I need to do this.
You know, it's true.
I lie to my son all the time.
I steal from him.
Where do you think I got this t-shirt? - It's cute.
- Thanks.
I guess we just have different parenting styles.
Jason and I have a long-term plan based on honesty, and you're a liar.
(Laughs) Uh, okay, I don't think - you're quite as honest with your kids as you think.
- Yes, I am.
What about the fat bearded man in the red coat? - What? Was that someone you dated? - No.
- Well, you date a lot of fat guys.
- Santa.
Santa doesn't count as lying.
Oh, really? So you tell them that a big, fat man comes down a tiny chimney, and that's not a lie? Right, that's not a lie.
(Sighs) Oh, my God.
Okay, maybe you're right.
- You know, maybe I should tell them the truth.
- Thank you.
Kids! (Gasps) Not now! No! No, Emily! No, Jane, I have to do this or I'll be a lying parent like you.
Sweethearts, there's something you need to know about Santa.
Nonsense! No, Emily! Shut! Santa Claus is a made-up person.
(Sighs) Childhood officially over.
(Camera shutter snaps) And there's your Christmas card.
Excuse me.
Oh, excuse me.
Baby on board.
Cutting.
- Hi.
Can I have a decaf mocha? - Hey! No cuts, fatty.
Oh, go ahead and cut.
Well, hello? Is this fair? She gets to cut in line just 'cause she's pregnant? Oh, great.
Perfect.
Well, I guess if I was Excuse me Everybody, but, um, I just found out that I'm pregnant, too.
(Chuckles) Yeah, I got a text.
Yeah, I know.
It's crazy 'cause I'm, like, 50.
(Chuckles) Oh! - No, it's it's a miracle.
- (Woman) Oh, yes! - (Man) Congratulations.
Mazel Tov.
- Congratulations.
Thank you.
In the meantime, you know what? I'm actually gonna cut right in front of you because, um I really have to pee.
(Chuckles) - You know us pregnant ladies and our tiny, little bladders.
- Uh-huh.
.
(Wailing) Shh, shh.
Hey, hey.
Hi.
So sorry I'm late.
A taco fell in my gear shift.
Almost got in a terrible accident.
She's Ben crying all morning.
- Oh, that's okay.
Got her.
I got her.
- Honey, your Manny's here.
Everything's fine.
Yeah.
I know.
(Laughs) Whoa, look at that! - What did you say? - It's whale language.
- You know, it's hard to translate in English.
- Okay.
.
Are you busy Friday night? Oh, Jane.
Look, I know you have this whole Angela/Tony ""who's the boss?"" Fantasy thing going, but I'm sorry.
I'm just not attracted to you.
Can't force these things.
.
Oh! Yeah.
.
No, I need you to babysit.
- And I'm not attracted to you either.
- Yeah, right.
No, I actually have a date.
A date? You have a date? (Sighs) Well, no.
.
I mean, it's it's just dinner with this guy at work Shep who's really funny.
He does the funniest Borat impression.
He's like ""My sister, she's prostitute"" Okay.
You would laugh if you'd saw him do it.
Anyway, listen, I gotta go.
But Friday? Can you do Friday? Oh, I can't do friday night.
- Why? - I have date with Tina, you know from Tina's tacos.
Yeah, I mean, she's okay, but the tacos, ooh, they're amazing.
This is the only time I can squeeze this in.
Please? Um What if I do an early date? I'll be back by 9:00.
I promise.
- Okay, okay.
But remember, I love these tacos.
- Quick dinner.
thank you.
- Okay.
- They're like brothers to me.
I mean, don't take this the wrong way, but if a runaway bus was heading towards you and this taco place, I mean, I don't know who I'd push out of the way.
- They're good tacos.
- Okay, yeah, okay.
Bye Sophie.
- Alright guys, call me if you need anything.
- Alright, take it easy.
You like tacos? - Emily? - What? Did I tell you that I'm pregnant? - I know.
It's crazy 'cause I'm, like, 50.
- Oh, my this is a miracle of science! It really is.
Can I feel? - Sure, knock yourself out.
- (Laughs) Ohh.
- How about that? - I think I just felt it kick.
- You did not.
- I did! No, no, no, probably not.
- I definitely did.
.
Oh, my God.
Wait, is the dad that guy with one hand from New Year's Eve? - Sure.
Yeah.
How many hands are you gonna have, little fella? - Okay, that's not funny.
- Okay, but I'm kidding I'm not pregnant, Emily.
- What?! I'm, like, 50.
I don't even have my period anymore.
Well, I don't know.
There was a man on ""Oprah"" who had a baby.
- Anything's possible.
- Could I please use your stuffed armadillo as a stomach.
- It's a bedbug.
- How could I have ever made that mistake? Silly me.
- Rosemary, why are you doing this? - I think it's kind of a social experiment.
Mm-hmm? I mean, the pregnant woman in this society has been elevated to the level of a goddess, Emily, and I really wanna get a piece of it.
I want the attention and the back rubs - and the free food and the whole nine.
- Okay.
I mean, where's the harm in it, right? It's a bounty.
It's there for the taking.
Oh! I'm sorry I'm late oh, it was a morning from hell.
- My Manny was late.
- So who cares? You never hear me going on about kids and family trauma.
Yeah, well, that'd be kind of weird, Blair, - since you don't have kids.
- Actually, I have 4 girl 11, boy 8, two 3-year-old twins.
That is blowing my mind.
I have worked here for 12 years, - and I had no idea you had kids.
- Yeah, well, that's because I never bring my personal life into the office, Jane.
Hey, Jane.
You look pretty.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Hey, I gotta tell you, I'm looking forward to our big third date Friday night.
- How do you feel about Ethiopian food or do you prefer forks? - No, it's our first date.
No, no, no, no.
It's our third date.
There was that time we had coffee first date, and then and then the time we were trapped in the rainstorm on the way to the parking lot very wet, very cinematic.
I said, ""isn't this romantic?"" Or at least I thought it.
That was the second date, and then this will be the third.
- Oh, I I I didn't know those were counting.
- Oh, you gotta count 'em.
- Okay, uh, whoa.
So that's so it's our third date.
- Big three, yeah.
(Imitating Borat) Yeah, great success.
Wawa wee wa! (Laughs) Can you can you do that on my voice mail - so my Manny can hear it? - (Normal voice) Absolutely.
Yeah.
(Imitates Borat) That would be nice.
(Laughs) - (Normal voice) Does he like Borat? - No.
(Cell phone rings) (Beep) Hello? - Hello, this is Bill's teacher.
- What? - Can you come down here immediately, please? - I'm on it.
(Children screaming) (Children screaming) Liz? Liz? Liz.
Hello.
Liz? Liz, what is going on? H he's a monster.
- What? - Your son's a monster.
What are you talking about? That's right.
Your family doesn't believe in monsters.
And there's no Santa and there's no tooth fairy, and since you were born in America, there's no way you'll grow up to be a princess.
(Screaming) Oh, my God.
(Children continue screaming, loud clattering) What have I done? Yeah, my soul mate, such a beautiful spirit.
(Chuckles) The father of my unborn child.
And now he's dead.
Huh.
Oh, gosh.
So super dead.
And now this little creature right here, who loves his half caf, will never know that poor, dear, sweet, dead daddy.
- Did you said half caf? - What? Let me get that for ya.
Is that sweet? Total stranger.
Yeah.
Hey, let's make it caf caf.
Just this once couldn't hurt, right? And one of those silver commuter mugs.
Those are good for the environment.
Ooh.
Excuse me for a moment.
Oh my God.
Is it mine? - I don't know.
Is it? - I don't know.
Is it? I should have never bought condoms at the dollar store.
It's fake.
Okay, it's fake.
Feel it.
- Does that turn you on? - A little bit.
Mm.
Why you doing it? I'm doing a little social experiment, hanging out with my new preggy buds Gettin' some free stuff.
(Clears throat) I want in.
(Scoffs) Can you be cool? - I think so.
- Don't let me down.
Hey, everybody! Look who I found.
- This is Horatio, my stay-at-home-dad friend - (Woman) Aw.
And his baby Lark.
(Woman) Oh! (Woman chuckles) Here is the thing it's not f first date.
I just found out it's our third date.
Third date? That means sex, right? I mean, when I was dating, that meant sex.
Yeah, even when I was living in the Andes with the Zen masters, third date meant sex.
Plus, you got a goat.
Well, on our third date Jason and I made sweet love for the first time.
It was exactly 46 minutes long, which is the perfect duration for intercourse.
Okay, hey, I can't do this.
I'm not ready.
Well, Jane, do you not like sex? I mean, a lot of people don't like it, and asexual people can lead fulfilling lives.
You could pick up a craft.
Oh, yeah, that would be great.
The sexless neuter lad - that's a blast.
- Yeah, a lot of road rage and mall walking.
Hey, guys, I like sex, okay? And uh - people have even told me I'm very good at it.
- Oh.
Wow.
- Really? - If you must know.
Yeah, a lot of guys have said Okay, not a lot.
I mean, the right amount.
- Listen, Shep is cute.
- Yeah.
It's been 15 months.
Right, and when are you ever gonna have this time again? Yeah, I should do it.
When am I gonna have two hours even? You're not, so just do it.
You can do it, Jane.
- You can do it.
- Yes, yes, I can I do this.
Yes, I can! - Right, you can do it.
- Just go get down on it.
It's just like riding a bicycle, just without the seat.
Okay, thank you.
Very helpful.
I'm hanging up now.
(Beep) (Sighs) Is it irritating that I'm still here? So as you know, - the parents are really upset - Mm.
about the Bill incident.
We believe that we did the right thing by being honest with Bill.
- (Jason) Mm-hmm.
- You know, 'cause at the end of the day, only honest and truthful parents can raise honest and truthful kids.
- Listen to her.
That is so beautiful! Who said that? - (Laughs) Thank you.
Me! I did! Oh! Dr.
Phil.
I don't think you understand how bad this really was.
It was, um, it was the death of innocence.
(Clicks tongue) And your son was the lone gunman.
- Oh, no.
- Baby, what's going on? - You're not actually buying this, are you? - No.
- Why are you getting so upset? - Because it is.
It's she's right.
- That's that's enough.
Enough touching.
- It's the it's the death of innocence.
Okay, but our our our child was the lone gunman.
But we at home, we were together on this.
- What is going on? - Well, we were having sex! Okay? I would've backed you on anything, Emily.
(Sighs) Hey, listen, we agreed.
We said we'd tell the kids about Santa when they were 9.
- Well, I was in a situation! - No, you weren't.
No, you weren't.
You deviated from the plan.
Well, now you know how it felt when Esther took her first steps in front of you! Oh! You know what? She just did it.
You were in the bathroom.
What'd you want me to do? - Say, ""no, don't take your "" - You could've knocked her down and waited for me! - This isn't my fault.
This is not my - Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, I know nothing's your fault! - Indoor voices, please.
- Oh, I get it.
Oh, really? Okay.
Okay.
This is not my fault, okay? You deviated from the plan.
- And you know what? I'm gonna deviate, too.
- Oh, are you? - Yeah, Bill's playing pee wee football.
- Okay, great.
You know what? Meeting adjourned, all right? We all agree that I'm the worst mother in the world! How I I get out of this chair? (Scoffs) On mother's day, I'm gonna go to a movie all by myself and then cry myself to sleep! And then I'll go and get my tubes tied, and everyone will be happy! Thank you very much.

-(Imitates Borat) It's nice.
- (Normal voice) Yeah.
Perfect.
That's right.
It sounded great.
- (Normal voice) Oh, I don't know.
- You know what just happened? - What? - Third date just officially started.
Yep, just now.
- Really? Okay, good.
Everyone, listen.
Uh, I hate to spring this on all of you, but, uh, we just got word from the suits that we're gonna have to have that sexual harassment seminar - that we've all been dreading.
- What? How long could this take? (Man) Not long.
Uh, apparently, someone's ex-assistant interpreted a little light banter, some mild tussling and a little lingerie show as harassment.
So we've gotta do this now uh, tonight before the subpoena.
(Man) Hey, Betty.
You have something on the front of your sweater my eyes.
(Laughs) Okay.
Um, all right, situation 23 what should Betty's correct response be? Um, okay, uh, ""a"" ""oh, Glenn, you are so funny.
"" (Laughs) That'd be mine.
""B"" ""Glenn, you're a pig.
"" Well, no.
Uh, or ""c"" she stays quiet and she sees her supervisor to file a report.
Well, that that is lame.
I I'm not making it up.
Honestly, where I come from, that would be considered a compliment.
Can we please move on? Okay, now I got away with it in '87, but that was a corporate thing, and you probably don't want to try it here, but I'm just gonna tell you - this attorney in Venezuela was amazing.
Okay, and we're done.
- Oh! Let's go.
And we're moving on to the discussion session.
Are you kidding me?! Blair, it is past 8:00.
I am sure no one has any questions.
Ah, yes, Mari Alice.
It's, uh, it's actually Rhoda.
Uh, and this isn't so much a question as it's a a personal story.
(Whispers) Why?! Um, there was this one time I was in the break room.
It was so crowded.
And a large man walked in.
Yes? And he pressed himself up against me at the food machine.
Oh.
Now I know he was going in for a candy bar (Sighs) But I'm not a stupid person.
- I know what he was doing.
- Hey.
- And this large man was enjoying himself.
- It's Fat Chris.
We all know you're talking about Fat Chris.
Okay, it's a small space, and it's happened to all of us.
Thank you for sharing.
That's it.
Let's go, guys.
- It's over.
Thank you.
- I have one more thing to say.
No.
Thank you.
Blair, come on.
Thank you so much.
So helpful.
You've really helped a lot of people today.
Thank you.
We get it.
We get it.
No sex talk in the work place.
(Blair) Well, we're all here.
Let's get a drink.
- Drop your pants.
- What? Shep, I have, like, 17 minutes before I lose my Manny.
So why don't we just third date right here? - (Imitates Borat) Nice.
Sexy time.
- Okay.
No Borat.
- No, of course not.
- No.
Mmm.
And then we can have a lingerie show.
I think there's some wine in my desk.
- Oh, my God.
- Wow, that is dirty.
- Okay.
Uhh! - You two are in serious breach of company policy.
Uh, technically, um, he's my supervisor, so I, uh, you should talk to him.
I've gotta go.
I'm sorry.
I had a really good time.
Me, too.
Aah.
Great third date.
That was what are you doing? - Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
- Um, stop it.
(All) Surprise! It's a baby shower? Presents! Yay! Aw, you guys! (Laughs) You really didn't have to, but I'm glad you did.
- What is this, a blue-ray DVD player?- I'm the pregnant one.
That's mine.
Give it! Put it down! Are you crazy?! - Put it down! - But I want it! (Gasps) (Gasps) (Chuckles nervously) Uh Hey, how's it going? (Chuckles) Mm.
How dare you lie to us like this? (Sighs) (Laughs) Okay, you guys, listen, I am really sorry.
You guys are such nice people, and I feel so bad.
I don't even really know why I did this now.
I just I I guess I was jealous.
You know, 15 years ago, when I was pregnant, and I was, I was in the Peace Corps, and we were in the Congo, and there were, like, no perks.
No prenatal massage, no cute little maternity tops.
I mean, it was like snakes and malaria, so it was a little bit different.
Do you know what I'm saying? So I think that I just kinda wanted to get a piece of what it is that you guys all take for granted.
Please don't hold it against me that I was in the Peace Corps or that I dated a guy that was in the Peace Corps.
Okay, that's fair.
And then I just ran out, so I don't even know how it ended.
Oh, I hope Shep didn't get fired, and I hope no one found my thong on the fax machine.
Well, you know, Jason and I had hours of the most amazing makeup sex and then a bunch of the regular sex, and during snack break, we came up with a plan - to make it up to the kids.
- Hey, guys, you think all this red's - washing me out a little bit? What do you guys think? - No, you look great! Oh, it's perfect.
Yay! What are you packing, dude? That looks fantastic.
This is 90% quilted poly-fiber and, uh, 10% chalupas.
That is nice.
Nice shape.
Oh, God! I miss being pregnant.
It just makes your legs look so skinny.
I know, right? Okay, so you know the drill, right? You're gonna get up - on that roof and then - Right, right, yeah, I got it.
I've dressed up like Santa a thousand times.
Some ladies are into that.
Uh, anyway how's this? (Deep voice) Ho ho ho! Yes! You know, no, I've seen it.
Do something new.
Mix it up.
Try like this.
(Nasally, singsong voice) Ho ho ho.
- (Esther) Mom, we're home! - Oh! Places, everyone! It's happening, people.
Let's go.
Places! Look at my little sister lying to her kids.
I know.
Now she's just a normal mom, - just like everybody else.
- Oh, don't ever say that.
Okay, hi, kids.
You know what? I've got some important news for you.
I was misinformed there really is a Santa Claus! Thank you, Rosemary! Rosemary, you just stole that precious moment from me.
What? Don't be petty, Emily.
Look how happy they are.
Hey, and, guys? Look outside.
- There's a surprise from aunt Jane! - (Horatio, deep voice) Ho ho ho! (Screams) (Thud) (Gasps) (Horatio groaning) No! So much blood! Mommy killed Santa.
Don't worry, kids.
That's not blood.
It's it's Christmas juice.",fail
9,Truth Be Told,"1 One second.
I go kitchen, get your order.
Perfect.
Thanks.
Boom.
What'd I tell ya? I'm not buying the accent.
What's to buy? Russell, most people who work in a Chinese restaurant have an accent.
But not all of them do, and yet all of them do.
You think that she's faking the accent so the orange chicken tastes better? I'm just saying being Asian and faking an Asian accent She's ""Uncle Tom yumming"" it.
Wow.
I don't think we're allowed to talk about these things.
I know I'm not.
But I can.
Watch this.
Oh, God.
Here you go.
Enjoy.
Syeh-syeh.
You see that, Mitch? I just said ""thank you"" in Chinese, and she looked at me blankly.
Yeah, I think the look was, ""Why is this black dude speaking Chinese?"" Are you really upset about this, or is this a bit for your stand-up? Are you asking me if I can turn all of this off? I cannot.
It's the black Porsche.
Thanks, bro.
- [laughs.]
- [cell phone vibrates.]
I'm getting a text.
It tickles.
Dope! My beautiful bride just scored us four tickets to Jay Z.
- Oh, sweet! - Me, Angie, you, Tracy.
- Tracy's gonna love this.
- Dude, tomorrow night? Oh, what? This sucks.
You and Tracy still don't have a new sitter.
It's been two months! The only person Tracy will sign off on is her mom.
Ooh.
And the search continues.
You got to say something.
I'm not wasting my breath, Mitch.
It's a valet stand, not Selma.
- Then I'm saying something.
- No, no.
I'm your best man.
That did not end at your wedding.
I'm your best man everywhere we go.
I should've made my brother my best man.
Hey.
Hey, Professor.
You're not teaching your ethics class right now.
Oh, yes, I am.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Hello.
This is not my car.
This is his car.
Okay.
My car is a PT Cruiser A convertible PT Cruiser.
Which is why we took my car.
Hurtful.
The point is that this Porsche or ""Porscha"" I don't even know how to pronounce it.
Both: ""Porscha.
"" - See? This car is his, and I think that you assumed it was mine because you don't think a black man can afford a fancy automobile.
Well, actually, I thought it was yours because there's a John Mayer CD playing.
Yeah, that's my CD.
We done here, Reverend Sharpton? We are.
You know, you're exhausting.
- I really am.
- Mm-hmm.
Don't look now I said don't look now 'Cause here we are Guys, why don't we just do dinner at your place? We live 30 feet away from you.
Because I needed a night out, and 30 feet is within range of Sadie's old baby monitor.
Oh, at least it's supposed to be.
Come on! You haven't been blessed with a sweet angelic four-year-old.
We want to die.
Remind me in the morning to get an estimate on a vasectomy.
Well, I'm a doctor.
I'll do it for free right now.
[laughter.]
Tracy hasn't had a real night out in 45 days.
46! Unbelievable.
I can FaceTime my grandmother in the Philippines.
I can't get a clear picture of my daughter right next door.
This stupid piece of Oh, my angel.
Oh, babe.
Okay.
Thank you, Lord, for this food and our friends.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
Ange, I noticed you eyeing the Moo Shu.
You want to put down that cup of algae and maybe get in on this? I desperately do, but I've only got 36 hours left of my cleanse, and mama's got to look good in her dress tomorrow night.
But Daddy likes that booty the way it is.
Oh, man.
They're gonna have sex and watch ""House of Cards.
"" Ange, how'd you score Jay Z tickets anyway? I asked everyone at my firm, and no one could hook me up.
Ange got the Head of Pediatrics to pull a favor.
Those doctors are nothing without their residents.
Oh, well, actually, Dr.
Kessman couldn't come through, so I asked Marcus.
What? Marcus? Who's Marcus? Marcus and I kind of went out for a while.
You dated for two years right before we started dating.
- On and off.
- You lived together.
We didn't live together.
I had my own apartment.
- You're talking to me, not your dad.
- Am I? I was just unaware that you two were still communicating.
- I mean, have you seen him? - No.
We just text sometimes.
What kind of texts? You know, like, ""Can you hook me and my husband and our friends up with four tickets to Jay Z?"" All I heard was ""hook up.
"" Screw it.
Pass me them ribs.
Oh, babe, that concert's tomorrow night.
We have 24 hours to either find a sitter or get Sadie way into Jay Z.
[baby fussing.]
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- Where is that stupid - They had another baby? They're just gonna keep trying until they have a boy.
Just play catch with your daughters! Shh, shh.
Doesn't it feel like every time they come home, it's from the hospital? I bet they have an amazing sitter.
- Mitch.
- Excuse me a sec.
- No, no.
- Yes, yes! I'm just gonna ask 'em, Jew to Jew.
M'lady needs a night out.
Look, as badly as I want one, I can't steal another mother's babysitter, can I? No.
I can't, I can't.
It's a sacred rule.
We're not breaking any rules.
The concert is tomorrow night, Friday night, the Sabbath.
They don't go out on Friday nights.
Isn't saying ""they"" offensive? It would be if I were talking about all orthodox Jewish people, who, for religious reasons, don't go out on Friday nights, but I'm not talking about all orthodox Jewish people.
I am talking about the Goldsteins.
The Goldmans.
Okay.
Well, that was offensive.
Okay.
I want to apologize for my behavior earlier.
I guess I misunderstood.
I thought when we got married, we were gonna stop dating other people.
Babe, I didn't mention Marcus because I didn't think it was a big deal.
You won.
You got me.
You got all of this.
Come here.
I'm gonna go take a shower.
You give me a two-minute head start, then join me.
Hmm.
That is if you're still up for it.
Oh, I'm still up for it, yeah.
Hey, but this time, we're going till the water gets cold, hello.
Hello.
Mm.
[cell phone chimes.]
Marcus, my man, you are really wrecking the mood, bro.
[in tune of ""Hava Nagila"".]
I got the number I got the number I got the number We're going out Friday night Both: Yay! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.
- Signal, signal.
- Oh, yeah.
What you doing? Huh? No, I wasn't.
Were you looking through my text? I-I thought that was my phone.
You thought your phone was the one with the pink case? And now I see that it is not.
[scoffs.]
You know what? Look, we have no secrets.
No.
I trust you.
Do you? I'm gonna leave my phone right here, and while I'm gone, you feel free to take a look.
Boop.
- So did you look? - Of course I looked! - You had to look! - I had to look.
I mean, if I can figure out your password in four tries, you're basically telling me to look.
She is telling you to look.
So what did that dirt bag say? Ha! He said, and I quote, ""Leaving tickets at will call.
Still trying to get you backstage passes.
"" The balls on this guy.
Ugh.
- I shouldn't have looked.
- Why would you look? But on the plus side, backstage passes.
You guys got to find a babysitter! Oh.
Oh, yeah.
About that And I brought my boys with me Say what up to TyTy You found a sitter? We're interviewing her in, like, 20 minutes.
Oh, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, wait, wait.
Tracy hasn't met her yet? No, no.
But she's agreed to keep an open mind.
The same way she agreed to keep an open mind about your bachelor party? We ended up going bowling and painting plates.
I'm telling you, Tracy is committed to seeing Jay Z.
All right.
And I brought my boys with me [singing along.]
Say what up to TyTy Still sipping Mai Tais Sitting courtside Knicks and Nets give me high five - Ni - No, no! - No! - No what? No! No! Okay, okay, I get it.
I can't say that word.
You cannot.
But I can't sing it? You cannot.
Mitch, it's it's just not a word that you have access to.
You should hear me do it because I don't pronounce the R.
You better not pronounce the R.
What if I hum it? Sort of sort of like ""N"" Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-bah.
No, no.
Why don't why don't you just do the Alicia Keys part? Alicia Keys part? Yeah.
I don't know if I'm pretty enough.
Hey you are plenty pretty.
Boop.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's go! Top down, baby! Let's go for it! The world is your stage! Whoo! [high-pitched voice.]
In New York Concrete jungle where dreams are made of There's nothing you can't do I think what you're doing here is actually more offensive.
Now you're in New York These streets will make you feel brand-new Yes, I get pedicures.
Every man should.
Hey, Sadie! Hey, Uncle Russell.
Daddy, I have a rash.
Oh, no, Sweetie.
Where's your rash? On my ""bagina.
"" Oh.
Trace? Our daughter asked a specific question, so I'm gonna use the correct terminology.
Makes sense to me.
They grow up so fast.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Babe, grab that tiara and those plastic heels, please.
- All right.
- Oh, that's right.
I heard we're circling a new sitter.
She seemed nice on the phone.
We'll see.
Sounds like our favorite litigator is ready for cross-examination.
Objection.
I am in mom mode right now.
Yeah, but, Trace, remember how we talked about keeping an open mind.
Right.
Open mind.
- Glass half full.
Don't forget the code.
- The code? If Tracy feels there's no way we're hiring the person, she gives me a code.
""Did you defrost the chicken?"" So we can cut the interview short.
Why waste our time if it's not gonna happen? It's all part of our open mind.
[doorbell rings.]
Hey, guys, is a half-naked daughter the first impression you're looking to make? Good catch.
Okay, I'll get the door.
You get her dressed.
Buttons, babe.
If it has a zipper, it's as good as off.
Daddy, do you have a ""bagina""? And I'm getting the door.
Yep.
- All right? - Yeah.
Okay.
All right, everybody, we need this.
Hi.
I'm Kimberly.
Hey, Trace, don't forget to defrost the chicken! Yeah.
I learned CPR when I was a lifeguard.
I practically lived in my bathing suit.
Oh, don't you just love how soft these are? We don't have a pool.
The whole lifeguard thing It's just not relevant.
Well, Kimberly, you seem great.
Yeah, but we've been meeting with a lot of potential babysitters.
Who have all been horrendous - Yeah.
- Till you.
Wait.
What's happening? I know that this is last-minute, but can you come back and babysit tonight? - Yeah.
Totally.
- Great! - Great! - Come on.
Great.
Mitch, your wife signed off on the hot babysitter.
What's the problem? She's hot! The real problem is how you're saying it.
Say it like this.
""She is hot!"" Russell, I'm a white guy Yes.
Who's married to a woman who's ethnically ambiguous.
What is she? If we hire a babysitter who's also ethnically ambiguous, it's gonna look like I have a thing.
But don't you have a thing? Okay, this is this is exactly why we can't hire her.
- Because you do have a thing.
- Whether or not I have a thing.
And my gut tells me that you do.
All right.
The first rule of marriage is the best boobs in the house should belong to Tracy.
Hey, Tracy.
Tracy's here.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you guys talking about? Marriage and just how great it is.
Isn't spooning the best? Liar.
What are you really talking about? Actually, we were just talking about Kimberly.
You know, she's kind of Delicious? Totally.
I trust you.
Oh, I trust me too.
I trust me not to put myself in these situations.
Were you planning on sleeping with her? - No! - Of course not.
So what's happening here is you're making a problem where one doesn't exist.
- Oh, that's his jam.
- [car alarm beeps.]
Mitch, you're being crazy.
Oh, what'd he do Yell at another cop for texting and driving? No, worse.
We found a great babysitter.
Kimberly is fantastic.
In fact, we're already Facebook friends, and she friended me, which never happens.
I mean, not never.
You know, I'm cool - In fact - Stay on topic.
Right.
But this one doesn't want us hiring her because she's hot.
Don't hire that girl.
- Thank you! - What? It's the same reason I put my camera in the safe when I'm in a hotel.
I totally trust the maid, but why create a problem? And by ""camera,"" she means ""potato chips.
"" That's right, Princess.
I trust Mitch.
I just don't trust this Kimberly girl.
[cell phone chimes.]
Everything okay with the tickets? Yeah.
He wasn't texting me about the tickets.
This pretend tea party is about to get real.
Well, then what was he texting you about? Nothing.
Idris Elba is gonna be on ""Fallon"" tonight, and he knows I have a thing for him.
Idris Elba.
- I don't know who that is.
- [doorbell rings.]
Oh, sweetie, I'm gonna show you some Google images that are gonna change your life.
That is if that's okay with you.
I'm cool with Idris.
She never went to St.
Barts with him.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Sorry to interrupt high tea.
Oh, well, there's actually no tea in it at all.
It's totally pretend.
I think she figured it out.
Wait.
Is everything okay? Tell me we're still on for tonight.
Absolutely.
I just left my books here, and I need to return them to the library.
Did you hear that? Even I have overdue library books.
You look familiar.
You ever been to the Laugh Factory? No.
That's just his way of telling you he does stand-up.
I'm exceptional onstage.
You never told me when you want me.
Oh, my God, what? Oh, uh 7:00.
Yeah, 7:00's good.
Yeah, let's go with 7:00.
And you have the address 'cause Yeah.
It's right here.
Mitch, you're adorable.
And by ""adorable,"" I mean ""harmless.
"" And by ""harmless,"" I mean you pose no physical threat to women.
Hire that girl.
Thank you.
I'm going out.
Mama is going out! I'm going out! To a different zip code, hey! Hey! We're going out.
We got a sitter.
We're getting our lives back.
You guys were right.
I mean, Kimberly is great.
Little hiccup.
I realize why she looks familiar.
Your babysitter does porn.
- What? - Yeah.
Yeah.
Pretty sure I've seen her ""bagina.
"" Wait.
So whose wife are we hiding from? All of them.
All of the wives! I have to be absolutely sure that you saw our babysitter doing porn before I destroy her reputation with Tracy.
I can't remember exactly which clip it was.
Just put ""Kimberly, babysitter"" in the search bar.
First of all, I doubt she performs under the name Kimberly.
And second of all, if I put ""babysitter"" into the search bar, we're gonna be here for, like, four days.
We don't have four days.
We have 90 minutes until the concert starts.
I still need to take a shower.
I have no idea what I'm gonna wear.
- Jeans and a button-down.
- But am I tucking? Just I'm working.
[keys clacking.]
""Amateur.
""Interracial.
Orgy.
"" Here it is.
[sultry music plays.]
That's not her.
That's not her.
Don't celebrate just yet, cowboy.
Did you not hear me type ""orgy""? Yeah.
- Wow.
Look at that.
- What, what? That staircase really opens up the house.
Are you fast forward.
You know, there's a nicer way to do that.
Did somebody order pizza? [chuckles.]
Pizza delivery, really? Ten bucks says when he opens up that pizza box, there's gonna be a - That's her.
That's her.
- Is it? I think I think so.
- It's hard to tell.
- Yeah.
You only see her face for, like, three seconds.
Can you freeze it on her? What is she playing, pleasure or pain? It's like she's sneezing while getting her finger slammed in a car door.
- Yeah.
Play it again.
- Wait.
One second.
You got to check out this one girl first.
Please, just go back! You know, Mitch, sometimes, you can be real uptight.
That is so not true.
Then why are you wearing a seat belt? I have to tell Tracy.
The thing is, you don't.
Don't I have a responsibility to disclose what I know to my wife? You have responsibility to be a good husband.
For the last month and a half, your wife hasn't been saying, ""Mitch, be honest with me.
"" What she has been saying is, ""Get me out of this house!"" Forget honesty.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was I having dinner last night with a different black friend who made the same pro-honesty argument to his wife? No.
It was me.
I'm your only black friend.
Only because you get jealous.
Otherwise, I might be friends with Marcus.
Oh, damn, I said it.
Look, what if it is Kimberly in that video? Does that mean that she can't be a good babysitter? I mean, from what we've seen, she is pretty good at multitasking.
So you do think it's her? No! I don't know.
Why? You want to watch it again? Tonight's gonna be great, man.
Don't wreck it.
How often do you get backstage passes to Jay Z? - Marcus came through? - Yeah, he's super great.
Look at the butterfly.
Wait.
Didn't the other girl have a tattoo on the inside of her arm? - That was a pepperoni.
- Oh, damn it.
We get it, guys.
She's a hot babysitter.
- Move on.
- Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
You look fantastic! I know.
I do.
I do! 'Cause I'm going out.
Mama's going out! Unless you think we should reconsider.
Too late.
Popped the tags.
This dress is going out with or without me.
Oh, you heard the woman.
We are wheels up in 60 seconds! - ""Wheels up""? - You have no idea what kind of pressure I'm working under here.
What the hell is going on? Nothing.
Don't lie to me, husband.
Fine.
Mitchell thinks that he may have seen Kimberly in an adult film.
That girl was in a porno? All right, sweetie.
Look, Mommy and Daddy are leaving, okay? You can watch one video.
Kimberly, can you just make sure it's something appropriate? - You know, I just - 45 seconds! Do we know for a fact this girl moonlights? We do not.
Well, if you see something, say something, but if you just think it's something, shut the hell up.
My girl T needs this night out.
And I left money in case you want to have pizza delivered.
Oh, my God.
What's this? Jay Z's opening act is John Mayer! What? We better stop talking and leave.
Oh, and don't let any strangers in the house.
Or people you do know.
[sneezes.]
[sultry jazz music.]
[upbeat music.]
- We're going out! - Finally! - Here we come, Jay Z! - Our sitter does porn! [tires screech.]
Possibly.
Your sitter possibly does porn.
Going out.
Did somebody order pizza? - No.
- Yep, it's her! She's totally got Kimberly's vaguely Asian cheekbones.
No, this girl's got some black in her.
Oh, you better believe Don't say it.
If only we had a photo of her.
Oh, that's it! We're Facebook friends.
Oh, yeah.
Hurry.
If it's not her, we can still get there by 8:15.
They never start on time.
Who, black people? No, concerts.
God, no.
Mitch, your white guilt amuses me.
Okay.
She's got photos up from Christmas, a trip to Mount Rushmore.
See? People go to that.
Ooh, Six Flags, Six Flags.
Oh, click on that video of her on the log ride.
How ironic is that? Oh, my God! Side-by-side.
- One, two - Three.
Did somebody order pizza? Oh, my God.
Tough call.
What are you guys doing? - Oh, hey, Pumpkin! - Hi, sweetie! Why are you sitting in the driveway watching videos of me? You guys are sick! Kimberly, wait! Oh, I already popped the tags.
When she said, ""Why are you watching videos of me,"" was she talking about the log ride one or the other one? Did she storm off because she was offended? Or because she got caught.
Guys, the point is we don't have a sitter.
Did she say ""video"" or ""videos""? And here's the big ethical question.
How much of this do we mention to the Goldmans? Hmm.
It is the Goldmans, right? I've been calling them the Goldfeins.
Again, we're sorry.
Dude, no problem.
You know, Kanye's coming next month.
I'll just have Angie text Marcus, see if he can hook us up.
Wait.
Now you're okay with Angie texting Marcus? Turns out Marcus has a fiancÃ©e.
And you wouldn't cheat on her for Rihanna.
- Yo, you seeing this? - Yeah.
It's your fake Chinese accent girl.
Yeah, Idris was on ""Fallon.
"" He's so hot.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? Keep it close.
[laughter.]
- Did she just - Yep.
- You want me to say something? - I do not.",fail
10,Rob,"Oh, my God! I can't believe we're really married! I know.
I know.
Mmm.
We didn't rush into this, did we? -No.
No.
-No.
If getting married impulsively was a bad idea, Vegas wouldn't have chapels open at 3:00 in the morning.
Right.
Right.
It's crazy.
It's just crazy.
Six weeks ago, a guy comes running into my dress shop to get away from a bee, and now I'm married to him.
I guess I can tell you now.
-What? -I made up the bee.
I saw you through the window, and you looked really cute.
So wait.
So so why were you waving your arms around your head like that? That's just the way I run.
-So where should I put my stuff? -Anywhere you want.
This is your place now.
Come on, make yourself at home.
-Okay.
Okay! -Anywhere you want.
Ah, but not there.
Not there.
No, I I just reorganized that closet.
That's all.
But anywhere else you want.
Okay.
Oh I know you have your charming little OCD thing, but is this really how we want to be spending our time right now? Give me that thing.
Rob, what are you doing? Nothing.
Nothing.
I I'm coming.
Good morning married guy.
Good morning, married lady.
Hey, is that my shirt? Yes.
I found it in the closet.
Mmm.
God, it looks cute.
That knot's going to put a wrinkle in it, but, uh it's okay.
to my parents' house to tell them we got married.
But it's so beautiful out.
I thought we'd stay inside and have sex all day.
I'm their only child.
I got married yesterday.
They're probably going to want to know about it.
Yeah, but why do we have to go there? I sent my parents a text.
Look, we've talked about this 100 times, okay? Mexican families don't work that way.
You said you were close to your family, too.
I am.
I see them almost every Christmas.
My mom's kind of needy that way.
Get dressed.
You can complain in the car.
Did I mention, uh staying indoors and having sex all day? It's just going to be my mom and my dad.
-Okay.
-And maybe my aunt and uncle.
-All right.
-And their kids.
And also some cousins.
And their kids.
And mi abuelita, who you probably won't see because she's mourning my poor grandfather who died in 1992.
And some second cousins.
Now, uh these people, they're all Mexican? Yes.
Just mentally preparing myself.
That's all.
I mean, you said this wasn't going to be a big deal.
And it isn't.
Look, marrying you is the biggest thing I've ever done without telling my parents first.
I don't want them to think I screwed up.
Why would they think that? They won't, honey.
-Just let me do the talking.
-Okay.
And don't tell them how old you are.
-Fine.
-And don't tell them your height.
Well, they can see how tall I am.
Okay.
Mami! Ah, mija! Que bonita! You speak Spanish? Papi! Hola.
Hi, everybody.
Oh, Fernando, pay the cabdriver.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No.
This is Rob, the one I told you about.
-Oh.
Oh.
-Yeah.
Oh, so we finally get to meet the famous Rob.
Ah.
Uh Everybody, look.
Guess who it is.
-It's, uh, Rob.
-Rob.
God, this is a big family.
Now I know what's going on during all those siestas, huh? That that was a joke.
I mean I mean, of course, this is a big family because you're all Catholic.
You don't you don't use protection.
What are you doing? Oh, I'm sorry.
I got nervous.
It's a lot of people.
I feel like I'm at, like, a Julio Iglesias concert or something.
I mean, when are you going to tell them we got married? That's kind of why we're here.
We've got to ease them into the idea that I'm not a little girl anymore who will just do anything they say.
-Margarita, come to the kitchen.
-SÃ­, Mami.
Don't leave me.
What am I supposed to do? So you're Rob.
Mr.
Gonzales, uh, first, I want to say, uh, I'm a huge fan of Mexican culture.
Mmm.
Uh, this dip is excellent.
I believe it's called, uh, guacamole.
Very impressive.
You know your stuff.
Also, uh, I'm a big supporter of, uh, immigration rights.
You know, I think those anti-immigration people are lunatics.
-You know what they ought to do They ought to build a giant wall across the border and patrol it with cannons.
What? I don't need any more competition.
-You can't just demand identification -Why not? Hey, I came here with nothing.
I started working at a car wash.
Now I own eight of them, huh? I got 100 people working for me.
And you make sure that they're all legal? Are you kidding? Between the 100 of them, I think they have, like, three social security numbers.
Mmm.
Can you hold that for me for a second? You're smoking in my house? We don't do that around here.
-Uh-uh.
-No.
That's disgusting.
Huh? -I'll throw that in the garbage.
-Ah, thank you, amor.
Thank you.
So, Rob, you're you're seeing our Margarita.
-Yes.
-What what do you do for a living? Uh, I'm a a landscape architect.
Oh.
You're a gardener.
No, I'm a landscape architect.
I I design outdoor areas to kind of interface Oh, no, no, I understand.
You're a gardener.
It's an honest living.
Just wish, sometimes, you people wouldn't use a leaf blower.
It's so noisy.
""You people""? Let me get you a drink.
Hey, look, I'm just going to sit here so no one else will bug me, huh? Just pretend you're talking to me.
That's a good one.
Funny.
Shut up.
You shut up.
I don't like you.
I don't like you, either.
I hate kids.
That's why I keep a cell phone next to my balls so I'll be less likely to ever make one.
Go away.
Hey, you know what? I'm going to sit here and do what I want.
What are you going to do about it? Ow! Stop hurting me! Help! I didn't I didn't touch him.
That that kid's a liar.
What's going on with Pepe? -He started it.
-Will you focus? I was really trying to sell you in the kitchen.
Why did you tell my mom you're a gardener? -I didn't say anything about -Margarita? Your father and I would like to speak to you upstairs.
What what am I -What am I doing? -No, no, no.
You just wait here and, uh, uh, enjoy the guacamole that you so impressively identified.
Hey! So you're Maggie's new hombre, eh? Nice to meet you, man.
Nice to meet you.
I'm her uncle, Hector.
I'm visiting from Mexico for the weekend.
That's nice.
I'm not leaving.
What? Ever.
You and me are going to be best friends.
Huh? I can feel it.
Well, maybe.
Let's see how things go, though, huh? Yeah.
I can't wait until we're spending time together, sharing our deepest secrets, lending each other $7,200.
Where's your lady, hmm? She's upstairs with her parents.
-Man! -What? That's not good.
WhyWhy is that not good? Every time I go upstairs with them, they say something bad.
""Hector, why did you steal our flat-screen television?"" ""Hector, why are you wearing my nightgown?"" ""Hector, what did you do to the guacamole? Hector!"" It's tough up there, man.
What did you do to the guacamole? Listen, they're up there turning her against you.
If I were you, I'd get up there before it's too late.
All right, well, thanks for the advice, but I'm just going to wait here for Maggie.
Okay.
Suit yourself, amigo.
I'm your best friend.
I'm not just trying to start a lot of drama to distract from what I'm doing in the garage.
I think I hear crying.
Maggie.
Maggie.
Maggie.
Maggie.
Man.
Oh! Hot! Ooh! Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey! Â¿TÃº quiÃ©n eres? What? No.
Â¿QuÃ© estÃ¡s haciendo? -Pero quÃ© -No, no, I -Â¿QuÃ© has hecho? -No, no, no.
-Shh.
Quiet.
Shh.
No, no, no.
-Ay dios mio de mi vida! No, no, no.
Aah! Fernando! -Fernando! -This is going to be our little secret.
Shh.
Ow! No.
Quiet.
Quiet.
No, no.
No, no.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Come on.
Come on.
No, no, no, no.
Shh.
Hi there.
Â¿MamÃ¡? There's a simple explanation, really.
See, uh I poured hot wax on my genitals.
I I think we're done here.
We're done? Oh, so you told them we're married? Because if you didn't, this would be a horrible time.
I thought there was a moment where things were going pretty good.
Was that before or after you humped my grandmother? Actually I think it was during.
Ok, too soon.
Not funny.
You're right.
No, not funny.
This is a disaster.
It's the turtle all over again.
Honey, I'm sorry waitwhat? When I was 10 years old my parents said I wasn't grown up enough to take care of a turtle.
So I went out and bought a turtle with my own money to prove them wrong about the turtle.
Siempre me echan en cara lo de la turtle.
Estoy harta de la stupid turtle.
Honey, I'll be honest the only thing I caught in there was ""turtle.
"" So what happened? Look, the details are not important.
Well, we had to get a new dishwasher.
I can fix this! You know? I'll come up with something.
You know, overcoming massive screw-ups is is not new territory for me.
I used to have bangs.
So is this our first fight? -I guess it is.
-So what happens now? I guess this is the part where we go home and have make-up sex.
I just humped your grandmother an hour ago.
I am not a machine! Okay.
I made the tamales my mom likes, we got empanadas for my dad, a pitcher of sangria I think we're all set! -Okay.
-Let's cancel.
Honey, relax.
I got the whole evening planned out and color-coded.
And if at the end of the night your parents still don't like me My whole life is over.
Well, I was going to say ""we still have each other"""" but that works, too, you know.
I'm telling you, this is the turtle all over again.
Oh, yeah, there were bits of shell in my food for weeks.
Ah, ah! That's for tomorrow night's dinner.
DÃ©jame, vieja.
What did they invite us over there for? We gotta talk some sense into her.
You talk some sense into her.
I'll just nod my head supportively, like a tonto bobblehead.
Let's get this over with.
There's a program I want to see on tonight.
They make a bunch of hoarders live in the same house.
I gotta see it.
Hector! Do you think we didn't give her enough attention? I mean, why does she want to marry an old, short guy anyway? Hey! Where's that idiot brother of yours? Hector! Come on! We gotta see Maggie and that guy we don't like.
I love that guy! He really gets me.
-Hey, hey, hey -Ah, ah! He's a growing boy.
Here, want a spoon? -Come on, let's go.
-Okay, vÃ¡monos.
Oh, we got to get my mother.
Mm.
I put her in the car an hour ago.
Okay Oh, God.
They're here.
Okay.
Okay.
Hello.
Welcome, everybody.
Uh, please, uh, feel free to wipe your feet on the mat or not, or not, okay, come on in.
I want to thank you all for coming.
-My driver's license.
-I found it on the floor.
Next to my mother's bed.
It probably fell out while Yeah.
Yeah.
Rob! My dearest friend.
They hate you.
So much.
Thanks for the tip.
Abuelita, I, uh I want to apologize, uh I know you don't speak English, but I'm sorry for what happened the other night, in your bedroom.
I, uh Okay, I'm going to step over here We, uh, want to welcome everyone to our casa.
Which means ""house"" We know what casa means.
Of course you do! 'Cause, uh You're Latino! Or Hispanic.
Which one is offensive? Both, actually.
We feel like you got the wrong impression of Rob at brunch.
But I'm sure you'll find Rob as funny and lovable and charming as I do.
Back to you, Rob.
Thank you, Maggie.
We have a lovely evening planned.
I hope you all brought your appetites.
We're not hungry.
Okay, well that takes care of dinner.
So, uh, no problem.
We'll just move straight forward on to after-dinner conversation.
Anything goes, you know? Really get to know each other, right? So Selena.
That was sad, huh? So young, really.
Okay.
Well, um, we'll move on to let's see what we got next.

Okay.
You're a little close.
Sorry, it's a little tight here.
It's a little tight.
Okay, okay, very close.
Somebody's breathing in my ear! Look, I feel like I'm on the subway here, I can't Oh Nobody panic! I'm not panicking.
Well, that, uh, brings us to the sangria toast.
I think it'd be a nice time right now, everybody.
Make a toast! Sangria toast! Who wants sangria? People like toasts.
Please, everybody.
And you need to add a little fruit.
Can't have sangria without fruit, you know what I'm saying? Grandma, please.
Enjoy.
Okay.
Can I make the toast? Yes.
Please.
I've been Rob's best friend for pfft three days.
And he's a truly wonderful and generous man.
The first time we met, he offered to lend me $7,200.
No, I didn't.
So you're calling my brother a liar? No, but he's lying.
I mean, that's I need some booze with-without a phone in it.
Ah, I'm missing Hoarder Mansion.
No, no.
Let me talk to your dad.
Mr.
G? Oh, dear God.
I thought, you know, maybe we could talk.
You know mano to mano Okay, but I'm gonna need tequila.
We can get you out of this.
It's a marriage, okay, not a gym membership.
-I don't want out of it.
-I know, I know.
Here's our lawyer's number.
He can do it in four days.
-We'll get you a Prius.
-Mom! All right, listen to me.
If you stay with him, you'll never get to wear high heels.
Mm? Never wear high heels again.
Mom, I love you.
And I know you want what's best for me.
But you just can't run my life the way you did when I was a little girl! You have to let me make my own decisions.
Okay, you can make your own decision next time.
Any Prius you want.
-Get blue.
-Ay, Ma! This may seem nutty, but, uh I get the feeling you guys don't like me.
Really? I was afraid we were being too subtle.
Look, I love your daughter more than anything else in this world.
And I know how important you guys are to her.
Which makes it important to me.
You know, as I'm sure that Rosa's parents were important to you.
Are you kidding? Rosa's parents hated me.
Well what did you do? Waited for them to die.
It took 11 years.
Well, I can't wait three or four years.
Look, I could probably forgive you.
It's Rosa that's the problem.
Look, she didn't get to pick out her wedding dress with her daughter.
She didn't get to plan a big reception where she could seat her sister at the crappy table near the bathroom.
You stole that from her.
Look, I'm sorry.
But can you at least talk to her? You know, try to get her to change her mind? You can't get your wife to change her mind.
That's crazy talk.
Come on.
You know, you've been in my shoes.
-Rosa's father to do for you? -Die faster.
Yeah.
I mean, what would you have wanted All right, all right.
I'll talk to her.
All right, all right.
Okay.
Everyone Uh, Fernando has something he he'd like to say.
-Rosa -What? I can't do this, man.
I can't do it.
You said you were gonna try.
I tried, you saw! I tried.
You didn't try, I didn't hear anything.
I I tried he tried to make me say things.
I didn't Okay, Fernando, get the car.
Margarita, leave your clothes, we'll buy you new ones.
Let's go.
No! Wait! No, wait! Wait! No one's going anywhere! I'm sorry I'm not younger, or taller.
I'm sorry I took three years of Spanish in high school and retained none of it.
I'm sorry that I didn't loan a complete stranger $7,200.
I'm sorry that you didn't get a chance to have that dream wedding for your daughter.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
But I'll tell you what I'm not sorry for.
I'm not sorry that I fell in love with your daughter.
And that I've never been happier.
Somehow, she fell in love with me, too.
I know we rushed off and got married, but I couldn't take the chance that she'd change her mind.
Mira, Mami, I know he's not exactly the guy you would have picked.
But what have you always wanted for me? For you to be happy, mija.
That's all we ever wanted.
I'm happy.
Mm.
You have to give me the recipe.
What kind of cell phone do you use? I'm proud of you.
Well, don't get too used to it.
I like to keep the bar pretty low.
Hey, let's get to bed, okay? We got to be at church with my family at 9:00.
Cousin Laura's baby's being baptized, and there's a party after.
You know, it's a good thing I know you're kidding, you know? Because you're You're serious, aren't you? I can't do this for the rest of my They just left 30 seconds ago! And you have to get out of here.

11,I Hate My Teenage Daughter,"And then you know what she said to me? ""You don't know how to dress.
"" Who says that? I'll tell you who says that A bitch.
I know! I know, right? I mean, I put up with that mess in high school.
I'm not gonna do it now.
I wouldn't even talk to her again.
Maybe I won't.
Oh, god.
Here she comes.
Ugh.
She's with that other one.
What are they doing here? Hey, mom.
Mackenzie.
Mother.
Totally.
God, why are they so mean to us? Because we're their moms.
God, I hate them.
Morning, mom.
Hey, babe.
I'm making your favorite, french toast.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You need to go change.
You are not wearing that to school.
You're wearing your pajama top to work, And I'm not saying anything about it.
Go change.
Why do we have to do this every day? Because you forget to put on clothes every day.
Change.
And for your information, this is not a pajama top! Crap.
Yes, it is.
Hey, annie.
Where's sophie? In her room changing out of that.
And into something a little more appropriate.
Yeah, my mom made me change, too.
Wh-where is your mom? Next door, fighting with my dad.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I guess this divorce is really hard on you, huh? You know, it's unfortunate.
That you have to resort to name-calling.
Well, it's unfortunate that you're such a frickin' dumb-ass.
Hi, annie.
Hey, dumb-ass.
What are we fighting about this morning? I want mackenzie to go to her first high school dance.
In a limo, and gary won't pay for it.
He says I have to get a job.
That's not such a terrible idea.
I mean, ""oprah's"" going off the air.
You won't have anything else to do.
I have a job.
I'm a mother and a damn good one.
You know mackenzie's dressed like a call girl today, right? Yeah, and that outfit cost me $300.
Get a job.
I don't want to be a working mom.
Those women are pathetic.
No offense, hon.
None taken, you lazy, stay-at-home whore.
Oh, sure, you laugh when she says it.
I have an idea.
Why don't you get a job.
Instead of playing golf with your stupid buddies? I'm a golf pro.
Those aren't my buddies.
They're my clients.
You think I enjoy hanging out with old white men all day? They call me ""tiger.
"" I want mackenzie to go in a limo, gary.
You know how I had to go to my first dance.
Yes, in the back of your dad's chicken truck.
That's right.
And what did everyone call me after that night? Kentucky fried nikki.
They filled my locker with drumsticks.
They were delicious.
Oh, honey.
At least you got to go to a high school dance.
I never even went to one.
My parents were so strict, I didn't get to go to dances.
Or listen to music or watch tv.
She never saw an episode of ""full house.
"" I had to tell her who the olsen twins were.
Wow.
High school must have sucked for you.
No, it was fabulous.
And you know what made it even better? My mom was a religious nut bag.
Who insisted on making all my clothes 'cause she felt that the gap was the devil's workshop.
So I went to school every day dressed like a sister-wife.
I'll give you the money for the limo.
Oh! I cannot believe tonight is our first high school dance.
I am so excited.
I barely slept last night.
Mom, it's our first high school dance, And if you show up anywhere near there, I'll kill myself.
Of course it's your dance.
That's what I meant.
We're just gonna poke our heads in.
I got you a corsage.
Look, this dance is very important for us.
Okay, we're popular, and we would like to stay that way.
And since you two were nerds in high school, You have no idea how important this is.
Hey, I wasn't a nerd.
I just had a touch of alopecia.
And I weighed over 300 pounds.
And my teeth grew every way but down, So no, I did not win miss abilene, But I certainly wasn't a nerd.
And I was not a nerd either.
I was a social outcast.
You know who else was a social outcast? Jesus.
And I'd say he's pretty popular.
All right! We're here.
Have a good day at school, girls.
Say no to sex and drugs.
Mom, can you come in to school with me today? Oh, my god.
It's happening.
I'm the cool mom.
Let's both get bangs.
No.
Uh, principal diego.
Wants to see the two of you before class starts.
Wait.
What? Later! I didn't want to get bangs anyway.
Bangs are stupid.
Hey, when did you get bangs? Why do you think the principal wants to see us? I am so nervous.
I'm gonna say a little prayer.
Good morning, ladies.
Come on in.
Nikki, you colored your hair.
You just never give up, do you, girl? God, that woman is awful.
Was she that mean when you guys were in high school? She was brutal.
She teased anyone who was different, Stole people's boyfriends, Thought she was better than everyone.
God, she was my idol.
Why don't you two take a seat.
And we'll get down to business? There's only one chair.
Look at you, talking back to the principal.
Ooh.
Chocolates.
Don't mind if I do.
Now I have to warn you, those are not sugar-free.
Oh, I don't have to worry about my weight any more.
That was just hormones anyway.
Oh, of course it was.
Those hormones made you eat everything in sight, Bless your heart.
And that one summer when your hormones got away from you.
And you had that little incident I did not eat my cat! That was just a rumor that you and your stupid friends started! I did not eat my cat.
Let's just get back to why we're here.
I wanted to talk to you about a little dustup.
That mackenzie and sophie were involved in.
Oh, god.
What did they do? Was it as bad as starting a rumor.
That someone barbecued and ate their own cat? We've moved on, nikki.
Your daughters locked a boy in the girls' bathroom.
He was in there for two hours before someone found him.
I mean, that just sounds like typical boy-girl stuff.
The boy they locked in the bathroom.
Was gerard thompson.
The kid in the wheelchair? Oh, god.
I know.
Now I'm gonna do my very best to keep this on the down-low, But if they serve wine at the p.
T.
A.
Meeting, No guarantees.
You know, before we freak out, We've only heard principal diego's side of this.
Maybe there's a good reason they Boy in wheelchair.
Hey, annie, great news.
My band got offered to tour with sheryl crow.
I know it's my weekend to take sophie, But I was kinda hoping that you could cover for me, Unless you've got something going on this weekend.
I'm just kidding.
I know you got nothing.
I have been trying to call you all morning.
Why didn't you answer your cell? Because if I learned one thing from when we were married, It is that you do not take a call from one girl.
When you're with another.
See, I do listen to you.
Do you listen to yourself? Matt, sophie got in trouble at school today.
She and mackenzie locked a handicapped boy.
In the bathroom.
Oh, no, no, no.
I can't have her doing that.
If sheryl crow finds out, it might make me look bad.
Matt, we have to handle this.
This is the worst thing sophie's ever done.
What did sophie do? Nothing.
I wasn't talking to you.
And I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my brother.
Sophie and mackenzie locked a handicapped kid.
In the bathroom, And we have to do something about it.
Wow.
That's shocking, even for them.
Nice job, ladies.
Thank you.
It is good to be appreciated.
Don't you have some dumb trial to get to? Well, I just freed a man.
Who was wrongfully convicted of murder 20 years ago, So my dumb trial is over, but thanks for asking.
20 years? Took you long enough.
Okay, you can't be surprised by this.
You've given sophie everything she wants.
Since the day she was born.
I don't think she's ever heard the word ""no.
"" She has heard the word ""no"" from me.
When she says, ""do you like uncle jack?"" I say no.
Look, I get it.
You spoil her because you don't want her.
To be a freak like you were growing up.
Wow.
Freak that's nice.
How else would you describe it? You lived in military lockdown and you dressed like.
A character from ""little house on the prairie.
"" Yeah, I don't know what that is.
Okay.
Look, all all I'm saying is.
That sophie is running the show here.
You need to step up and take control.
Hey, she's doing the best she can.
Sophie's a difficult kid.
Oh, I'm talking to you, too, matt.
You're not a great parent either.
Me? How can I be a bad parent? I'm never even here.
You know what? Don't worry about it, okay? Because sophie is gonna be punished appropriately.
And so is mackenzie, right, nik? Absolutely.
The minute she walks in the door, I'm gonna ask her what she thinks is appropriate punishment.
For such a heinous crime.
Yeah, I knew it.
Y'all aren't gonna do a thing.
It's cool.
I'll represent them.
When they knock off a liquor store.
Yes, we are gonna do something.
Mm-hmm.
Something big.
We are not gonna let them go to the dance.
Oh, mackenzie won't go for that.
Let's just wait and hear what she wants to do.
We're doing this, nik.
We're doing it, and we have to do it together.
Fine.
I just really wanted to go to that dance.
I even learned some moves from ""dirty dancing.
"" ""dirty dancing""! Ha! I actually know that one.
I picketed that movie with my church group.
Look, I understand that you're mad, But if you had a daughter that behaved this way, What would you do? Oh.
Okay, you gonna give me the silent treatment? That's cool, 'cause two can play at that game.
Okay, the thing is, I hate doing this.
I actually want you to go to the dance.
I- I want you to be able to do everything you want, But your behavior won't let me.
Can't you understand that? Say something.
Anything! Make fun of my shirt.
You love to do that.
Honey, don't let her rile you up.
It's what they want.
You sure you need that? What are you saying? Nothing.
Oh, good, because I'm gonna eat this.
I'm a grown woman.
I can do what I want.
Absolutely.
Help yourself.
You don't think I know what you're thinking? I know what you're thinking.
I know what you're all thinking.
I did not eat my cat! You are the meanest person I've ever met.
Oh, my god.
You are so ungrateful.
You are so unfair! Do you have any idea how hard I work.
To give you all the things you have? Just because you were a big loser in high school, It doesn't mean that I have to be one.
I hate you! Do you know how lucky you are? How would you like to spend every summer.
At vacation bible camp?! Honey, please don't be mad at me.
I hate it when you shut me out.
Can't we just go back to being best friends? We were never best friends.
Ah It's okay.
I know you didn't mean that.
What the hell is going on here? I've got, like, 50 texts from mackenzie.
Me, too.
Sophie's been texting me nonstop.
""Mom's out of control.
"" ""I hate it here.
"" ""I got my period.
You can relax.
"" Oh.
Sorry.
That's from a nice lady who sells t-shirts for our band.
Congrats, buddy.
That was touch-and-go for a while.
Well, as helpful as you two are being right now, Nikki and I have got this under control.
They are so mean.
You cannot leave me alone with those private school brats.
They were talking about me in spanish Or french.
I knew it wasn't english.
All right, you know what? We're stepping in here.
This is insane.
It's timfor a little tough love from their dads.
What is going on here? I got, like, 50 texts.
God, I cannot believe those girls.
They weren't from the girls.
They were from nikki.
Did you bring me the pies or not? Look, I owe you an apology.
I have no right to tell you how to parent.
I'm just her uncle.
And you're a good mom an okay mom you try.
Ha.
That apology sucked.
All right, let me let me try that again.
I Am truly sorry.
I know I can be overbearing.
And I tend to tell people what to do all the time, But I am going to stop, right after this.
Come on, nikki! Use a fork.
You're not a bear.
Look, it's it's very sweet of you to apologize.
And and I-I really appreciate how much you care about sophie.
It's not just sophie.
Oh.
You want a drink or something? No, I gotta go.
I have a date.
Oh.
I didn't know you were dating anyone.
Is it serious? I mean, it can't be that serious.
I haven't seen you with anybody? Is she cute? How old is she? I really should go.
But we're good, right? - Yeah.
- We are great.
We are awesome! Have fun on your date! ""Is she pretty? Am I pretty? Do you want to get married?"" Eat your pie, yogi.
Well, we got 'em settled down.
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna be giving you.
Any more trouble.
We took care of it.
Wow, what'd you do? What any good dad would do.
We let 'em express their feelings, And most importantly, we listened.
Yeah, and we gave 'em $100.
To get 'em to stop yelling at us.
Dude! I'm ridiculous?! Why would you give them money? We're divorced! I don't have to take care of you any more! Good lord, woman, you're covered in pie! Where's your evil twin? She's up in her room, Blogging about how much she hates her mother.
Where's your evil twin? She's in her room, reading mackenzie's blog and crying.
Look, I'm sorry that you had to miss.
Your first high school dance, But I cannot believe what you did to that handicapped boy.
Mom, gerard is the meanest kid in school.
He doesn't like black people.
He called mackenzie names and made her cry, And that's why we locked him in the bathroom.
Why didn't you tell me that before? 'Cause kenzie made me promise not to.
She said that if her mom found out, She would just run down to the school and embarrass her.
Well, she is very protective And very embarrassing.
I'm really sorry.
And I mean it.
You drive me crazy.
But I love you so much.
I love you, too, mom.
Come on.
Let's go home.
Mom? Hmm? I didn't mean it when I said that you were ruining my life.
I know you didn't, sweetie.
And I also didn't mean it when I said.
That you were too old to get a man.
Or that your hair smells like hamburger.
Or that you were gonna die alone or that Okay, sweetie, apology accepted.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I just came back over to say, ""dig us,"" right? We set up a punishment, and we followed through.
We sure did.
Oh, my god! You let mackenzie go to the dance! How did you know that? I didn't even look you in the eye.
Why did you let her go? You just undermined.
Everything we did tonight.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it.
When I went to check on her, I saw that she had put her party dress on, And she was sobbing, annie.
It reminded me of my high school prom.
It was the worst night of my life.
Oh, please.
That's what you said two nights ago.
When your jeggings split open at the PTA meeting.
And by the way, you should wear underwear to a PTA meeting.
This was worse.
The best-looking guy in school asked me to the prom.
It was the perfect night.
Until deanna and her stupid cheerleader friends got there.
They told me the only reason colton asked me.
Was because they dared him to.
Then they started laughing at my dress.
And at the bow I had taped to my head because of the al Alopecia, I know.
I spent the rest of the night crying in the bathroom.
And listening to lindsay murphy have a baby in the next stall.
Nikki, I had no idea.
So, yes, I do spoil mackenzie, but it's just because I can't bear the thought of her going through one second.
Of what I went through in high school.
I want her to be happy And famous.
But mostly happy.
Of course you do.
That's what makes you a good mom.
And mackenzie's a wonderful girl.
Really? No.
No, but She will be When she's in her 20s and she realizes.
All the amazing things you've done for her.
Seems like so far away.
I'll never survive it.
Yes, you will.
And I will, too.
And then we'll go live in hawaii like we always planned.
And we'll wear bikinis every day.
With skirts that cover our problem areas.
I'm really sorry I let her go.
But you should have seen her, annie.
She looked so beautiful.
My little girl's going to her first dance.
Yeah.
Where are you going? To tell sophie to get her dress on.
We're gonna be late for the dance.
I'll get you a corsage out of the fridge.
Wow! This is way more beautiful than I ever imagined.
I like that I'm wearing the corsage.
It makes me the girl.
Hello, ladies.
So glad you could join us.
Now we don't have a lot of food here, But I hear the pound is open till 10:00.
Okay, you know what? Knock it off, deanna.
You can't talk to nikki like that any more.
Oh, for goodness' sake, I'm kidding.
Where's your sense of humor? Oh! I didn't realize you were so funny.
Here's something you'll laugh at.
I have never been to a school fun-raiser.
Where your husband didn't hit on me.
Isn't that hilarious? Your dog is tiny, but she bites.
Thank you.
You're the best date I've ever had.
Oh, look at our girls.
They're having a blast.
Yeah.
But I still feel a little guilty about what they did.
To that poor gerard.
Yeah, uh, the girls didn't want me to tell you about this, But there's a good reason why they locked him in the bathroom.
Evidently, that kid doesn't like black people.
Are you freakin' kidding me? - Shh! - Don't make a scene.
You know why they didn't want you to tell me? Because that's gerard thompson.
Oh, my god.
They made the whole thing up.
We have, awful, terrible daughters.
Pretty, though.
And isn't that what really matters? You know what? We need to get them and take them home.
No, not home.
I can't do that again.
We have to find another way to punish them.
Oh, my god.
I feel so bad for you guys.
Why? difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue and Oh, no.
keep stalling and keeping me together people around got something to say now holding back, every day the same Are they watching? Oh, yeah.
Everybody's watching.
I still don't get why this is punishment for them, though.
I know you don't, sweetie.
Just keep dancing.
consider they forget my name ame, ame, ame they call me 'hell'.",fail
12,Allen Gregory,"Allen Gregory 1x01 Pilot Ya, ya Ya, ya Allen Gregory Allen, Allen.
Well, good evening.
Hello.
I'm Richard De Longpre.
And this incredible looking specimen standing next to me is my life partner, Jeremy De Longpre.
Hey, how's it going? Welcome to our home.
Well, okay, it's my home.
My name's on the deed.
Let's not make a big deal about it.
I'm not making a big deal out of it.
Well, I am, Jeremy! Since I'm not an unemployed housewife, Jeremy, who contributes absolutely no money to the mortgage, Jeremy! Richard, I thought we talked about you not humiliating me in front of crowds of people? Ah, we did, didn't we? I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid in love with you.
Mmm, mmm.
All right, Rich Mmm.
Okay, that's enough.
Mmm.
Mmm! Okay, we get it.
Anyway, tonight is not about Jeremy and his pettiness.
It is certainly not about showcasing the fact that we recently adopted an underprivileged Cambodian girl.
Julie, come on up here, sweetie! Oh, I really don't want to.
To think just a couple of years ago, Jules was living in the desert? The sea? Something.
Both of those places, yeah.
She was this close to being turned into glue over there when I said to myself, ""You know what? I've been blessed.
It's time to give back.
"" So, I selflessly logged onto that Web site and clicked ""Add Julie to Cart.
"" Ah.
her pathetic life was changed.
Let's all give a big ""you're welcome"" to Julie.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, in celebration of the only seven-year-old ever to be nominated for a Tony Award, please welcome, the reason we breathe, our son Allen Gregory De Longpre.
Thank you for coming, everyone.
Please lower your voices, I'm speaking.
Oh, Chloe's here.
And Julie hasn't found her way back into the crowd yet.
I apologize, folks.
She's making this incredibly uncomfortable.
She's pretty much the worst person.
Anyway, back to me.
When they first called and told me I'd been nominated for a Tony Award, I said one word pass.
But then I realized how selfish I was being.
How unfair it would be to deprive you of me winning this award.
Does that make sense? So, to everyone here whose fantasies are fueled by my achievements, I say this: ""We did it.
"" Well, I did it, let's not go completely nuts, you did absolutely nothing.
But how about this: You were there to see me do it.
Now drink up, you knuckleheads! Have a blast! It's our night, you crazies! Chloe, where are you? Son, we have something we need to talk to you about.
Jeremy has AIDS? Full-blownsies? That was kind of harsh.
No.
Jeremy wants to go back to work.
Well, to be fair, you've kind of been pressuring me to He's decided, due to his feelings of inadequacy, that it's time he pursue something for himself.
Instead of just being completely useless, sure, sure.
Yeah, so this means I'm not gonna be able to homeschool you anymore, bud.
Uh-huh.
Who we bringing in? Well, no one.
You are going to be attending elementary school actually.
Starting on Monday! What?! Really putting a damper on the ol' Tony nod.
Yeah, about that Tony nomination.
Yeah, apparently they don't nominate plays that are staged in our living room.
Not over, fighting 'em tooth and nail on it.
So this party was all Mmm, yeah Yeah, we thought if there was a crowd around you wouldn't freak out.
Yeah.
Well you thought wrong, my man.
Damn it, Jeremy! Ruined everything! You hunk! You're so handsome and stupid! Hey, Richard? I'm not sure, but it seemed like Allen Gregory didn't react positively to the school idea.
I can keep tutoring him.
I don't mind.
Jeremy, you need to get a job.
Why? Are we in trouble financially? No.
Okay, so if there are no money problems It has nothing to do with money, Jeremy.
I'm a De Longpre.
We have money.
I mean, look around-- we have expensive things.
Of course we have money.
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
Come here.
No, no, pop up here, Jerbear.
Look, whether we have money problems or we don't, we'll get through it together.
That makes me feel like we do, because if we didn't, there wouldn't be anything to get through? Shh, our love is so much stronger than our steady financial decline.
Wait, so there is Jeremy, stop reading into stuff.
You're starting to sound like the bank.
Hey, sorry for going ballistic back there.
I think the whole Julie being alive thing affected me more than I thought.
You know, maybe you're a little nervous about going to school.
I mean, it's a big change, pal.
Ugh, Jeremy, I so cannot deal with your dumb logic right now.
Like, where is this job stuff even coming from? Yeah, where is this coming from, Jeremy? You? Hey, Dad, do you think the kids at school will like me? I mean, not that I care.
Jeremy.
Oh, of course they will.
You are a bright, shining star.
They're going to love you.
Thanks, Dad, and thanks, Jeremy.
Ah, you're welcome.
For screwing up my entire life.
You didn't let me finish.
Please don't ever interrupt me again.
Well, that went well.
Come here, you.
Oh I'm really exhausted.
That's okay, I'll do the heavy lifting.
Ya, ya.
Ya, ya Ya, ya.
Guys, check this.
My doctor says I may be able to lose the back brace in three years.
Oh, congrats, Beth, and just in time for high school.
Score.
Yeah, because that brace is the only thing standing between us and sweeping popularity.
Bye, Wayne.
Nice new backpack, Wayne.
Thanks.
What's the matter, Jules? You didn't say good-bye to Wayne.
Yeah, do you have an issue with Wayne? 'Cause he's our best guy friend.
Right, that's kind of the problem, girls.
What's going on with you, Jules? You seem extra sour today.
I'm sorry, I'm in a dark place and I'm taking it out on you guys.
Well, what's up? Talk to us.
He starts school today and everyone's going to kiss his pretentious little a.
Ugh, I'm gonna vomit all over myself.
I'm not sure that would make you feel any better, but It wouldn't, Val, it wouldn't.
Then why would you do it? Okay, everyone, take your seats.
Oh, you must be our new student, Allen De Longpre.
Ah, wow.
Okay, how about it's Allen Gregory? And go ahead and only address me as that from now on.
Thanks so much.
Okay, um, welcome, please find a seat.
Sure, I will, directly after I do a brief Q and A.
Oh, well, we don't usually do I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
It's Ms.
Winthrop.
We're not in court, sweetheart, what's your first name? Gina, but you should never call me Gina, Gina, Gina, can I see you in the hallway for a second? Look, here's what's currently happening-- you're being difficult, and I see this whole situation running a lot smoother if you choose to cooperate.
Allen Gregory, I am your teacher and I need you to respect that.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I totally will respect that if you can respect that we are on the same exact level authority-wise.
Okay, that is absolutely not the case.
Great, I'll see you back in there.
Also, I wouldn't lose my mind if you decided to chew a stick of gum.
Thanks for understanding the sitch, Gina, you're a china doll.
Hey, I'm Patrick.
You want to sit with us? Are you implying you want to schedule a lunch? Yeah, I guess.
It works better for me if you say, ""Would you like to schedule a lunch?"" That way I know what you're talking about.
Okay, do you? Do I what now, sweetheart? Want to have lunch? No, but I'd like to schedule a lunch when you learn how to speak English.
Now, how's your Friday? 'Cause mine is insane.
And then I wiped all my boogers into my dad's hair, right in there.
Hey, Patrick, was I not clear? Don't come near this table ever.
Who's he? He's only the most popular kid in school.
Ah, the two heavyweights finally meet.
Sure you're tired of all the buzz.
Allen Gregory De Longpre.
Joel.
Zadak.
Zadak is class president.
He's also the fastest at times tables.
4 x 5: 20.
Wow.
How does he do that? Yep, he did it again.
He's lead singer in the chorus.
And captain of the kickball team, best at cursive.
It's like 8 x 6: 48.
It's not a big deal.
Yeah, it's not a big deal.
I lobbied for fuel-cell technology on Capitol Hill, I'm friends with Sandy Bullock, really good friends.
Who cares? It's not a pissing contest, right, J? Did anyone catch the Charlie Rose the evening before last? Did you catch it? No, nothing? Hang on a second, ladies.
I think we just may have found a bigger loser than us.
Good looking out, Wayne.
Aw, thanks, Wayne.
You got it.
Hey, just throwing out a random hypothetical to you.
Let's say there's a new kid in school and on paper he should be killing it, but for some reason the other kids don't like him? Why do you think that would be? Well, maybe you're just too smart for everybody.
Hmm, that's a good point, Pete.
You pick up on stuff, don't you? I don't know.
It's Patrick, though.
I don't care.
You know what? Let's forget all the mishegas and try to enjoy our lunch, huh? Take the edge off.
Excuse me.
Great, this train wreck.
What do you think you're doing? Ow! It's just a little Pinot Grige at lunch, Gina.
Hi.
Hello.
Mmm, that's good.
Let me ask you something.
Is it just like a complete mess down there? I'm gonna level with you.
It's like post-Katrina.
Oh, damn it, you're perfect.
Allen Gregory, Allen Gregory.
Allen Gregory.
Yeah, sorry, I've just never had my breath taken away from me like that before.
Okay.
Mrs.
Winthrop said you were drinking alcohol at lunch.
Shh, shut up, shut up.
Enough about that idiot.
Let's talk about us.
I'm sorry? I don't like to play games.
The whole wait three days to text you, flirt with other women in front of you.
It's exhausting.
Let's just cut to the chase.
We're in love with each other.
I think you have the wrong idea.
We're not going to be texting each other, we're not in love.
There's absolutely nothing between us.
There's a desk between us.
Okay.
Pencils, papers.
What's that? That looks like stool softener.
That's between us.
Okay, I've had just about enough of this.
Ah, me, too.
It's been a long day.
Why don't I call Jean-Michel at Il Portofino, we'll get a table outside? Ooh, I'm not getting a lick of service.
Babe, can I hop on your land-line? Allen Gregory.
What, are we dialing nine to get out? Is it nine? Allen Gregory.
Babe, I pick up, hit nine and then dial what? Allen Gregory, be quiet! What was that? Nothing.
Sounded like something.
Yeah, I should probably take off, though.
Hey, unrelated-- is there a bidet on school grounds? Never mind.
Hey, Joel, look-- the new kid is crying.
Yeah, I think he crapped himself.
I can smell it in my nose! Where you going, Allen Gregory? There's nothing back there for me, Pat.
I don't fit in either, you know.
But it gets easier.
We almost did it, didn't we? Did what? Take care of yourself, Red.
I'm proud of you.
Mmm Your belly skin is like suede.
Thanks.
Tough but soft.
Like a man.
Man on a hunt for a job.
Yeah, I'm looking.
It's hard out there.
But you'll have one soon? I mean, not that there's any rush.
Just want you to feel good about you-- immediately.
Oh! I wish we could make money off your belly skin! Um can someone please just sign my permission slip? Julie, there she is! What did you do today? Well, let's see I went to school, I got a permission slip, I asked you to sign it, you talked about which parts of Jeremy feel like suede.
You go to school? How fun is that?! You need anything else? A snack? You know you can help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Okay, thanks.
All right, well go get 'em.
She's great.
Oh! Allen Gregory? Are you okay, my boy angel? I have a broken heart.
And undergarments filled with my own unruly waste.
Who did this to you? Possibly the most ravishing gal I've ever seen.
Oh, who is she? Jeremy, please! Seriously, Jeremy! Why don't you go sprint and grab us a couple of Oranginas? So who is she? She's an older girl at school.
How old is she? Eight? Nine? I'd say she's comfortably in her late 60s.
Mm-hmm.
So what's the problem? I don't know.
I mean, she rambled on and on about how she's the principal and I'm a student.
What?! Here we go Oh, thanks, Jeremy.
I guess we'll just drink these without pita chips.
Dad they're animals.
I refuse to go back to that place.
What?! Oh, no, no, no, you don't mean that.
Pita chips Jeremy, enough with the pita chips! Get our jackets! Don't worry, Allen Gregory.
I'm gonna take care of this.
Hey.
Oh, my God, you scared the crap out of me, Julie! I thought you were a rat.
You're not quitting school, are you? Julie, I know you're extremely jealous of me and that manifests itself in moments like this, but I'm really fragile right now.
You know, you're 100% right.
I am so jealous.
Of what? Tell me.
Be specific.
I mean, you've only been in school half a day and everyone's already talking about you.
Who, Zadak? Joel Zadak? Sure.
Ah, I'll miss that guy.
But you have to go back.
Don't deprive these kids of the role model they deserve.
Is there anything I can do to help? Well, I guess maybe you could pack up your belongings All right.
and go back to wherever the hell you came from.
Does that make sense? So, it does make sense? No? Mr.
and Mr.
De Longpre, I'm so glad you called.
As superintendent of the school board, I want to personally apologize to you both.
It's terrible that Allen Gregory's first day wasn't a pleasurable experience.
We feel very lucky to have a De Longpre here at Feldstein.
Oh, we appreciate that.
Shh.
Thank you, Mr.
Rossmyre.
What can I do to get him back in here? You name it, you got it.
Cartay blanchay.
Wow, that is so nice of you.
I have to say, we were surprised that Principal Gottlieb wasn't more accommodating.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Oh, for God's sake, he's a child I'm not gonna date him.
Judy, first of all, calm yourself down.
I was just about to suggest that.
This is personal stuff between you and Allen Gregory De Longpre.
Whether you're gonna date him, you're not gonna date him, there's an age difference, I don't care.
It's none of my business.
Oh, my God.
Uh, uh, Judy, let me finish.
Now, whatever you want to do on your own time, I'll look the other way.
But inside these walls, you two are going to have to put your personal desires aside and act professionally.
The other parents can't know, the faculty can't No one's gonna know because it's not happening! Nice.
That's what you should say.
I'm not just saying it.
Even better.
Sold me.
You feel good? I want you to feel good.
Good here.
Jer? - I'm good.
- I'm not.
I really hope you can persuade Allen Gregory to return.
And, Gottlieb, for God's sake, try to keep it in your pants! There he is.
A to the G.
Hey, Carl-Trent.
Wait a second.
That's not the Allen Gregory I know.
What's got your bonnet full of all them bees? Carl-Trent can I ask you something? Have you ever not fit in? Aw, yeah.
Let me drop something on ya.
Back in L.
A.
, they came to me and asked, ""What do you think of David Boreanaz for Bones?"" They came to you for that? I was shocked, too! Considering my sordid history with the sisters Deschanel.
I was like, ""Boreanaz?"" I didn't see it.
But I was the only one.
And I felt that isolation.
So I took myself off the project.
You walked away.
I ran, AG.
I ran.
Oh, Allen Gregory.
There you are.
We talked to Principal Gottlieb, she's come to her senses, everything's coolio.
You can go back, Jeremy can get that job, train back a-chuggin'.
Thanks, but that's all in the past.
I've taken time to reflect on things, and I'm not going back.
Rich, can I have a moment alone with our son? For what? I just want to talk to him.
Mm-hmm.
About what? About the situation.
What are you gonna say? I don't know exactly.
I just want to talk to him.
About what again? Please? Just five minutes? You got three.
Can I ask you something? If you're over the whole Gottlieb thing, then why aren't you gonna go back? Julie mentioned the other kids were kind of rough on you.
Does that have anything to do with it? Did she also mention that she sucks and doesn't know what the hell she's talking about? Uh, no, she didn't mention that.
Well, there you go.
Allen Gregory five years ago, I was a straight man.
I had a wife, two kids, rock solid career.
I was happier than I had ever been.
And then one day, I had a meeting with a potential client.
He was an older gay man, and we had a connection-- a strictly platonic one, given my lifelong heterosexuality-- but, uh, he wouldn't take no for an answer.
He persisted, he followed me everywhere, gave me flowers, gifts.
He believed, deep within his heart, that we were destined to be together.
And you started to believe it, too? Uh.
The point is, Allen Gregory, that all the obstacles-- you know, me being straight as an arrow, my wife and kids, the restraining orders-- they were irrelevant.
In the end, he got what he wanted.
Because you see, son Don't call me ""son.
"" Sorry about that.
He didn't give up.
If you want those kids to accept you, you just got to convince them that they want that, too.
Jeremy? Thanks.
You're welcome.
I saw what you did.
And I can't tell you how much it meant to me.
You are my hero.
Well, that means a lot to me.
Sauna.
No one in there, we could probably go towel-less.
I sign off on it.
Thanks, Carl-Trent.
What's going on? Hey, Pat.
What are you doing, Allen Gregory? You broke my window.
Well, it's the middle of the night, silly.
I'm not gonna ring the doorbell.
Use your head.
Sorry, but, um, what's so important? Patrick, I wanted you to be the first to know.
I'm coming back to school tomorrow.
Okay, but I feel like that could have waited till tomorrow? I'm returning to Feldstein Elementary for the long haul.
Patrick, is everything all right? I'm gonna head out.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Wait.
Get some sleep, you rascal.
Don't be up too late.
What? I'm gonna be in so much trouble! But it's worth it, isn't it? Is it? Allen Gregory we are so proud of you.
Gyna.
Hey, so walk me through what happened yesterday.
I remember your pants were clean but then later, you were running out crying like a baby, and they weren't clean.
What happened in the middle there? Oh, you're hilarious.
No, that wasn't me.
It wasn't you? Then who the hell was it? It was an ill-advised mix of strip mall Thai food and cheap coffee.
It came on so fast, by the time it hit me it was too late.
I crapped myself, and I apologize.
It was completely unprofessional of me.
And when I ran crying past Joel Zadak, his friends Ian and Guillermo-- hey, guys-- that was embarrassing, to say the least.
Could have sworn it was the new kid.
Me, too, Guillermo.
Me, too.
Hey.
You look really cute today.
Listen, this is gonna be tough, I know.
It's gonna take some serious restraint on our part.
But what we have is rare.
Super spesh.
But I'm afraid we can't act on it, Jude.
Please leave me alone.
I get it.
You have something on your cheek.
It's still there.
Come on, let me.
No.
Would you stop? Just bend down, I'll get it for you.
There you go.",fail
13,Hank,"""OK, stay close everyone.
Our car will be here in a second"" I just hate that the whole city is watching our lives being carted away.
Nobody knows it's our stuff, Tilly.
Keep it moving, boys.
Keep it moving.
They're bringing the car up right now.
Thank you, Don.
We've got a long drive to Virginia.
I read about what happened to you in the papers, Mr.
Pryor.
I'm sorry you lost your everything.
That's very kind of you, don.
But don't feel sorry for Hank Pryor.
Never feel sorry for Hank Pryor.
You can feel sorry for the woman who lives with Hank Pryor.
I'm gonna miss this place, Hank.
Tilly, let me tell you again what I told the board of my company this downturn is an opportunity for us to find out what we're made of, to emerge stronger, to snatch success from the jaws of failure.
You should have seen their faces, Til.
It killed them to fire me.
Bastards.
- Unanimous bastards.
- Yes.
It's gonna take a lot more than a hostile takeover and losing all our savings to get me down.
I'm Hank Pryor, damn it.
I'm gonna get us back up on top, maybe not today maybe today.
Maybe today.
There's the smile.
When you first told me you wanted to move back to river bend, I sort of wanted to, I don't know, kick ya.
But I mean, I did grow up there, and now there's a part of me that's looking forward to the move.
- Of course.
Of course.
- Not a big part.
Come on, though.
River be where better to rise from the ashes than where I opened the very first Pryor sporting goods 170 stores ago? - Yeah, it's also where you met me.
- That, too.
That, too.
There goes our mattress.
We've had many an exciting evening on the old girl? Not lately, but still.
- Who's that with Madelyn? - Spencer.
Spencer? Well, they've been dating for five months, Hank.
He looks like an idiot.
Is he an idiot? Henry, honey, that's dangerous.
Excited I am.
Undertaking a grand adventure are we.
Why is the boy talking like that? What? It's Yoda, Hank.
Yoda's his hero.
What, the kung fu frog from ""Star Wars"" is his hero? That boy needs me, Tilly.
Now that I'm no longer a slave to that damn company, I've got a chance to be a real hands-on dad.
This is an opportunity for us to start over as a family.
Team Pryor.
Yeah, you know, I guess, in a way, we're lucky.
We're blessed.
If you and I weren't us, i'd wish we were.
There's our car.
Children, let's go! Consuela arrivederci.
-= 101 =- ""Pilot"" VO By : Â¤AkaÂ¤ Team Subs-Addicts"" This is lovely.
Trees, grass it's like we're living in Central Park.
Which was our other option.
I'm kidding.
Here we go.
This Is exactly what we needed to simplify, get back to basics.
No more long walks to the kitchen.
The kitchen's right there.
And we never knew our neighbors in New York, but here, in river bend look.
There he is.
Hello! He seems like a Cheery Fellow.
Maybe later he'll bring us a pie.
Then we can bring him a shirt.
Speaking of local flavor, my brother's gonna drop by later.
Probably eager to welcome us back to his tax bracket.
- Mom! Mommy! - Henry, we're in here, honey.
Virginia is awesome.
I cannot wait to go to the bathroom here.
Yes, I imagine that's one of the activities we'll all enjoy.
Sweetheart, why don't you go out and check out the backyard? I'll bet you there's tons of fun stuff out there that you and your daddy can do together.
Maybe later we can go out and throw a baseball.
At what? I hope there's a shed.
I need a place for my secret projects.
He's an odd little duck, isn't he? Oh My God.
It's like a horror film in here.
At least in a horror film, the pretty girl dies.
Even the stove is trying to make a run for it.
Mom, why does god hate us? Honey - I don't know.
- Tilly.
Madelyn, why don't you just give a chance? I think you'll soon be saying what your mother and I are saying ""Yes, we can.
"" You can't use that.
That's Obama's thing.
He owns those words, does he? You know, my high school baseball team had the same slogan on our run to the state finals Yes, we can.
Ultimately, of course, we couldn't.
But Not because of me.
I hit.
500 for the series.
That is such a great story, daddy.
Tell it again.
Fine.
You don't want me to say ""Yes, we can""? I'll do the President one better.
I say, yes, we will.
Yeah, because you're better than him.
He's the President.
- I could have been president.
- Yeah, right.
This is America, young lady.
A rich white man has just as much a chance of being President as anybody else.
What the hell was that? Consuela! Oh, right.
Hank, now that you're gonna be spending some time at home, and it looks like you're actually gonna try to speak to the children, why don't you let me tell you a little bit about them? Please.
Okay, go ahead.
For example, with Maddie, whenever I say anything to her I don't ask myself, ""how is Maddie going to react?"" I ask myself, ""how is moody going to react?"" Trust me.
Moody Maddie.
Hyper Henry.
Moody.
Hyper.
Good tip.
Got it.
Say have you got any secret nickname for dealing with me? Awesome Hank.
Awesome Hank.
Not bad.
I've called this meeting because moving day has gotten off to a rocky start.
Now at the pryor corporation you know what, Tilly? Perhaps you should take some notes.
At pryor corp.
, we attacked challenges as a team.
Now every team needs a leader.
Fortunately for us, we have me.
I am assigning each of you one room to unpack.
Our goal to climb into our beds this evening so that we may sleep soundly with the satisfaction of a job well done.
Now, Madelyn, your assignment will be to - cell phones off, please.
- Hey, Spencer.
No talking during a family meeting.
- No, I'm not doing anything right now.
- No leaving during a family meeting.
What the hell? Henry, site, stay.
Here's your notes, chief.
So this is supposed to be me with my head inside my bottom.
Excuse me, Mr.
Pryor, where do you want this couch to go? - Right, that should go - That goes in the family room.
Thank.
Wait.
Family room? What room is this? This is the living room.
The living room? W need a living room and a family room? That sounds a little silly.
I mean, not silly.
Not silly.
Just I was I was hoping that that room could be my office, my office/study.
Well, it's gonna be the family room, so sorry/no.
There they are! Hyre we go.
Somersault, half-twist.
Yes, he nailed it.
- Hello, Grady.
- Hey, put that away.
I'm hugging ya.
Coming in for a hug.
You know, it was really nice of you to stop by, - we actually stil - Hi, uncle Grady.
Hey, henry! Put her there.
Tall you are.
Strong with the force is this one.
Super Kyle, you remember your cousin Henry.
I'll show you the backyard.
I think there's something - dead back there.
- What? I got you something special.
Yes, a little housewarming.
I was gonna get you a bottle of champagne.
Then I thought, Grady.
Probably don't want to remind 'em of the good life right now.
- Very thoughtful of you.
- Yes.
Thank you for the 5-pack.
Yeah, I thought I'd drop by.
Just gotta check on one of my crews out on a kitchen remodel job a little bit later.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bring up work in front of you.
Shoot.
Shoot! It's all right, Grady.
I've got a few irons in the fire.
Damn it! Do you have to enjoy this so much? The heart wants what the heart wants.
How you doing, Matilda? I've been worried about you up there in Fancy Town.
It's been a really rough three months.
Nothing that can't be fixed with a little family and a whole lot of booze.
Listen, Hank, if there's anything I can do for you in your time of need and failure, let me know.
I want to be with you in your darkest hour.
Something tells me if it's our darkest hour, you'll be around.
This fell off the banister earlier.
You think you can fix it? Sure.
Got a lot of little things to fix around here.
I'll just put it on the list.
List? So what, you recommend that we buy a house that needs work, and you're a building contractor? What a wonderful coincidence for you.
Don't worry about it, Hank.
I'll give you a family discount 5%.
There you are.
There is no running out on a family meeting.
I'm on the phone.
Hi, uncle Grady.
- I'll call you right back.
- Hey, Maddie! How you doing, kiddo? Just talking to my boyfriend.
He's back in New York.
Long distance relationship.
That's a toughie.
Yes, it is.
Thank you for noticing, uncle Grady.
Honey, come on.
Let me handle this.
Now listen up, Moody maddie.
- Did you call me Moody? - No, I didn't.
I think you did.
Moody.
Moody maddie is that, like, what you call me behind my back? No, it's just what your mother no! It is good to have you back.
So you think I'm Moody? You don't like all my moods? - No, honey, I love all your moods.
- So you do think I have moods.
- That everybody has moods.
- Fine.
You know what? I'm just gonna have one mood from now, then you can't call me Moody anymore.
This is my only mood! Problem solved.
I cannot believe you called her Moody and then pointed the finger right at me.
Is that your idea of team Pryor? Well, I'm sorry.
Never should have put that ridiculous Moody Maddie thing into my head.
It is not ridiculous.
You know what's ridiculous? This family meeting.
The children and I are not your employees.
Of course not, but can't we all pull together as a family and do as I say? Excuse me? We can't get this mattress up the stairs.
- They're too narrow.
- What? But that's our bed.
Well, then you're sleeping downstairs.
Nice house you found us, Grady.
What are you gonna tell me next the backyard's a pet cemetery? Don't worry about it, Hank.
I can have my guys widen those stairs.
- By tonight? - No.
Tell you what, I'll loan you Kyle's old fire truck bed for tonight.
And, what the hell? I'll take that king-size jobber off your hands.
Let's go, boys.
Kyle, time to hit the road! I just found your mom an anniversary present.
This is not right.
Hank.
Come on, honey.
It's just a mattress.
It's not just the mattress, Tilly.
It's everything.
I don't get an office, my children don't listen to me and I cannot climb into bed and sleep with the satisfaction of a job well done because the job has not been done and I have no bed! You're breathing on me.
What? Your breath it's all over me.
Well, this is how I sleep, Hank.
- Well, this is how I sleep.
- Well, then get used to my breath.
Fine! I know that you are purposely sticking your butt into my stomach.
- It doesn't bother me.
- Good.
I'm glad it doesn't bother you, that how it's gonna be all night.
- Good.
- Good.
You like it? All night? You like it? You like it? Yes.
What? I like it.
It's like we're poor now, and all we have is our bodies.
- I'm so sorry about today.
- I'm sorry, too.
- It was so stressful.
- It was a stressful, stressful day But now it's the night.
Honey You can have that back room for your office.
Gosh.
Thanks, Til.
It's probably for the best.
That way I can get away.
Get away? - From what? - No, I mean out of the way.
I mean, out of your way, out of the kids' way.
I was in the way.
Does your pj's have a-a little drawstring or something? So what, you want to go back to the way things were before you actually had to spend time with your family? Good news.
I got it.
Unbelievable.
One day with us, you're ready to climb out a window.
Admit it.
You like the idea of being around me and the kids more than actually being - around me and the kids.
- How dare you! That is absolutely okay, here's the thing.
Look You're just so darn good with the kids, and Frankly, I felt like I was intruding on that today, so, yes, I think it would be better if I got myself set up in my office/study and focused on the Business/money side of things.
Hank, you know, I didn't love having you around today either, but I am not doing this on my own.
I can't.
I know it may not seem like it, but I am freaking out here! No, I get that.
You're are not backing out on me.
I'm used to having help.
I've always had Consuela.
Well, guess what.
You're Consuela now, buddy! So what? I'm just supposed to completely forget about getting a job? Look, I am not going back to the way things used to be.
You have got to be a part of this family.
I am a part of this family.
There's nothing the world more important to me than you and the children.
- Mommy? - Not now, Henry.
I mean, hello.
Come in.
What can I do for you, my son? I can't sleep.
I'm pretty sure there's a ghost in my room.
- Dad? - What? Me.
Of course.
Come on, henry.
Let's, tuck you back in to bedand we can talk.
To each other? That's the plan.
I think one of the ghosts was ringing a bell.
Rest assured there'll be no more bell ringing tonight.
Now, Henry, I know you like to use your imagination, and that is to be celebrated to an extent.
But when that imagination becomes more of a liability than an asset, perhaps it's time to rein it in a bit.
You with me so far? Good.
Now Franklin Roosevelt once said, ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
"" You've heard of Roosevelt? Famous.
President.
Dead guy.
It's like we just lit those tuition checks on fire.
You okay, Henry? Your brother couldn't sleep, so he and I are talking.
To each other? Well, I mean, when Henry freaks himself out, I usually just - come in here, and we hang out.
- Good.
Hang out.
How does that go, exactly? Well, I sit on the bed.
Facing him.
Then what? Then I sing to him.
She sings to you? Really? Yes.
I don't know what to sing.
It's the singing not the song.
O, say can you see By the dawn's early light Very funny.
You're singing to an 11 year old.
You are both awful, awful children.
- What's going on? - You have given me awful children.
I just got dad to sing ""the star-spangled banner.
"" Well, I am glad to be the family clown.
If this were the Pryor corporation This is the Pryor corporation now.
Fine.
I am putting the boy to bed.
I'm going to finish the job.
If you two will excuse me Now, Hank, just so you know, henry is potty trained.
Good night.
And, madelyn your mother didn't vote for Obama.
Just so you know, that singing thing was Maddie's idea.
She makes me do stuff.
Women are good at that.
Why do you think we had a second House Here you go.
I'll see you in the morning, Henry.
Can I leave light on tonight? I don't know.
It's just this room is different.
Everything's different.
It's a little scary having everything change, isn't it, having to start over? I'm a little scared, too.
How about that? Even at my age.
- And you're old.
- I'm not Old.
But I'm not 25.
- You're not 25 times 2.
- Yes, I know how old I am.
If you like, I could just lie down with you for a while.
Just when I thought they couldn't make a smaller bed.
Good night, Henry.
Good night, dad.
Dad? You're breathing on me.
Awful sweet, awesome Hank.
I just need to get a few hours sleep and then have some minor back surgery.
You know, I was thinking last night that back in New York, with all the money, the nannies and the staff, we insulated ourselves from the everyday struggles and challenges of real life.
How great was that? Just this is harder than I thought.
You're Hank Pryor, damn it.
At lst we got each other and a 5-pack of beer.
What the hell is that? Grady's starting to make some improvements.
Yeah, this is much better.
I'm okay! So Mr.
Family decided to work instead of spending time with his son.
I'll put it on the list.
Team Subs-Addicts""",fail
14,Work It,"Hey.
Hey.
Honey, how did it go? Well, the company actually folded while I was in the interview.
Oh.
But You stole all their sugar.
Yeah.
That's not all.
Mm-hmm.
And look, salt and pepper Ooh, hoo.
We got creamer, and wait for it.
Mm-hmm.
Wait for it.
Uh-huh.
Ketchup.
Ooh, hoo! Well, it'll all come in handy 'cause you got your last unemployment check today.
Oh, yeah.
I can't believe it's already been a year.
I can't either.
But don't worry about it.
As you can see, our lifestyle doesn't have to suffer.
Oh, hey, your insurance from Pontiac is about to run out, so I made an appointment for you to get a physical tomorrow.
No, sweetheart, I told you Oh, no, hey.
Lee, as a woman, I'm gonna have to ask you to stop comparing a prostate exam to the pinball scene in ""The Accused.
"" No, it's not okay.
Hey, dad.
Hey.
My phone's not working.
Oh.
Huh.
Well, let me take a look.
Oh, yeah.
Just as I suspected.
I cancelled your service.
What? I'm sorry, Kat.
Would a packet of soy sauce make you feel better? Look, it's just until I find a job.
Okay? But what am I gonna do in the meantime? Sweetie, we have a landline.
A landline? Don't those give you brain cancer? You know what? I'm just gonna have to find myself a rich, older boyfriend.
You and me both.
You and me both.
Check it out.
We're in the paper.
Mm.
Ah, they couldn't have done it without us.
Hey, don't worry about it.
I'm gonna figure something out, all right.
You know the deal.
If I'm working, you're working.
Right back at ya, bro.
Mm-hmm.
What's up, guys? Hey, Brian.
Hey, B.
Did you get your last check? Yep.
Hard to believe.
A year ago, we were sittin' pretty.
St.
Louis Pontiac's top salesman, head mechanic, and nearly accident-free courtesy shuttle driver.
Now look at us.
How did this happen? Well, it's a recession.
It's not a recession.
It's a mancession.
Look, women are taking over the workforce.
Soon, they'll start getting rid of men.
They'll just keep a few of us around as sex slaves.
That part doesn't sound so bad.
Not the kind of sex you like, Angel.
Just kissing and cuddling and Listening.
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm not going down without a fight.
I did hear they're hiring down at, uh, Astro Taco.
No! That place is a dump.
I mean, we still have our pride.
For now.
When the women take over, they'll make pride illegal.
That and eating on the toilet.
Ah, thanks, doc.
That prostate exam wasn't as bad as I expected.
Beers really took the edge off.
I love your bracelet.
It was a little present to myself.
I could wait around for a guy to buy it for me, but none of them have any money.
Oh.
So the drug business is good, uh? Bazonkers.
I have got more work than I can handle.
In fact, if you know anyone, we are looking to hire.
Uh, really? 'Cause I'm a salesman and I-I happen to be between jobs.
Oh, we're kind of just looking for girls.
Really? Why? Well, we've had some guys, but the doctors seem to want to nail them less.
Okay, see ya next time.
Um, Mr.
Standish? Yeah? How would you like to pay for your physical? What do you mean? I showed you my insurance card on the way in.
But your coverage lapsed last week.
What?! The total is $900.
Oh, my God.
How the hell am I gonna get $900? Oh, I'm sorry, Connie.
Lee Standish? Yes? We're ready for you.
Oh, well, wish me luck.
Thanks for the tampon.
hmm Hi.
I'm Vanessa Warner.
I run the midwest drug sales division here at Coreco.
Oh.
Lee Standish.
Um So I got a chance to look at your resume.
And I have to say, I'm intrigued.
Mm.
You sold Pontiacs? Oh, yes, yes.
Believe it or not, that it my actual resume.
What was it like working there? There couldn't have been many women.
No, I was the only one.
Mm.
That must've been hard.
Oh, it was! The guys were always sassing me or patting my Fanny or Ogling my my teats.
Well, you are a very Beautiful woman.
Oh.
And you played Football in college? Oh! Is that still on there? Yes.
I-I played lingerie football.
But anyway, what I really wanna talk about are some of the amazing pharmaceuticals that Coreco makes.
For instance, your new arthritis drug Polluxor? The results it's been getting in nonpartisan clinical trials are just stunning.
And the fact that it has all the advantages of low dose corticosteroids without any of the side effects of the Cox-2 selective nsaids? I mean, get out of town! You're impressive.
Mm.
Most of the girls who interview here think clinical trials are the things Lindsay Lohan keeps having to go to.
I'm not your ordinary girl.
No, you're not.
Honey.
Hi.
I got a job! Are are are you serious? Doing what? Uh, working as a salesman at drug company.
You know, talking in my regular voice, my genitals just hanging free.
Oh, honey! Yay! Oh! I don't wanna say that I'd given up hope, but, yeah, I kinda had.
Yeah, well, me, too.
Yeah.
My brave face was getting so tired.
But we did it.
We did it.
We made it through.
Mwah! Come on, I'm taking you out.
Let's celebrate.
Okay.
Let me just go get changed.
No, what you have on is fine.
We're just going to the bar.
The bar? Yeah, yeah.
I called Angel and Brian.
We're gonna m ah, Angel and Brian.
You know what? I suddenly do not feel like going out.
Okay.
I'll just wake you up for sex later.
Yeah? Okay, wait.
You seem mad.
What What is it? Why don't you give it some thought? And just see what you come up with.
Okay? Oh, sorry, ladies! A man got a job.
Guess you'll have to wait a little while longer for your sex slaves.
So when can we come by the office so you can take us out to lunch? Mm.
Mm.
Um Well, you know, I, um I don't get a lunch break.
Well, then how about getting us some job interviews? Uh come on, Brian.
The man just got hired.
Now he's supposed to put his ass on the line for you? I'm sorry.
It's just getting a little awkward living with my ex-wife.
The new husband? Not a big fan.
Thanks for getting him off my back.
No problem.
But we still have our deal, right? If you're working, I'm working.
Well, um I'm not sure you'd be up for everything This job requires.
But I'm Puerto Rican.
I'd be great at selling drugs.
Ah.
That's not what I mean.
Then what do you mean? Just that, um I don't think you'd totally fit in.
Oh, I get it.
It's because I'm a mechanic, right? No.
I'm not good enough to work in your fancy office? No, that's not what I meant, Angel.
I no, no.
It's good.
I'm glad to know what you really think of me.
Come on, man.
Enjoy your stupid celebration.
Ahem.
Uh, pardon me.
Mm-hmm? Oh! Hi, I'm I'm Lee.
I just finished my orientation.
I wasn't sure where my desk is.
Welcome! I'm Kelly.
Oh, hi.
This is your desk right here.
And wait.
Have we met before? Oh, I don't think so.
I've never been to that doctor's office.
You must be the giant car saleswoman.
Vanessa told me about you.
Yes, hi.
I'm I'm Lee Standish.
Yes, I know.
I'm Grace Hudson.
I've been the regional sales leader for the last couple of years.
But from what Vanessa tells me, it looks like I might have some competition.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Yeah, I don't know about that either.
Cute bag.
Oh, thank you! Come on, grace.
Don't be such a bitch.
What? I-I said I liked it.
We know what you meant.
We do? Oh! You must be the new girl! I'm Kristin.
I used to be the new girl, but not anymore! Please tell me you're not already in a book club.
So what's your story? Are you married? Wait, wait.
I'm really good at this.
Um, so no wedding ring, but I do see a tan line on your ring finger.
Mm.
So Divorced.
Did he leave you for someone smaller? Wow, you guys just dive right in, don't you? You're right.
We're so rude to pry.
Was it messy? Any traumatized kids at home? Well, I suppose there's no harm in telling you I-I do have a 14-year-old daughter.
Oh, my God! I'm a single mom, too.
Ethan is 8.
He's always the only one at ""bring your kid to work"" day, but now your daughter will be there, too! Oh, she can't.
She's, um She's in a bubble.
Oh, that's me.
Ooh, I should take this.
It's my, uh, my Waxer.
Hello? Hey, Lee, I don't like the way we left things.
We need to have a conversation.
Sweetheart, now's not a good time, okay? Me and the guys at work Hey, sweetie, we're gonna get some lunch.
Wanna join us? Who's that woman? I'll be right there.
And who's that woman? It's no one.

But just one more thing I have to say.
It's me.

Lee? Yeah.
This is what I had to do to get a job.
Okay, my eyes are up here.

You have to understand, this kind of thing doesn't really fly in my culture.
Oh! Oh, 'cause, you know, my culture just freakin' loves it.
Look, man, you're my best friend, you know? I cannot stand seeing you like this.
I'd be proud to work with you again, the fancy office and everything.
Hey, Angel, bathroom needs cleaning.
I just cleaned it ten minutes ago.
Welcome to Astro Taco.
I don't think you're ready for this jelly For this jelly I don't think you're ready I don't think you're ready for this Hey, Shakira, tone down the booty shake a little, will ya? This is what my body does, bro.
I don't think you're ready for this and my body's too bootylicious Hi.
I'm here for my interview.
Hi.
I'm Vanessa.
Likewise.
I mean, Angel Ortiz.
It's nice to meet you.
I love your scarf.
Oh, thank you.
And your ass looks tight in those pants.
Hey! How you doing? Oh, pretty good.
Little itchy.
I hope grace isn't being too rough on you.
She gave me a hard time when I first started working here, too, and now we're such good friends.
We even have nicknames for each other.
Like, I call her ""hottie"" or princess,"" and she calls me ""sausage fingers.
"" Anyway, I got you something.
Oh! Wow! Thank you.
Thank you so much! But can I ask you something? What what's so bad about my pocketbook? Besides the fact that you call it a pocketbook? Look, uh, don't take this the wrong way, but it seems like you haven't been shopping in this century.
Oh.
Really? Look, I-I know what it's like having to work and take care of a kid all by yourself.
Not that it was any easier when I was married.
My husband was no help.
He was always just hanging out at the bar with his friends.
Was yours like that? Well, maybe a little.
But, you know, he would invite me along to the bar.
Oh, ooh! What a prince! Anyway, the bag is just a reminder that you're a woman.
And you have needs.
You can't neglect yourself.
Well, maybe you're right.
Maybe I have been neglecting myself well, stop it! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh.
And inside the bag is the next selection for book club.
It's about a girl who comes of age during a spelling bee in Rwanda.
Oh.
Spoiler alert she dies.
Lee! Lee! Oh.
Um, pardon me for just one moment.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
How'd it go? I blew it.
Why didn't you tell me she was so hot? My ace bandage was holding on for dear life.
You you want me to talk to her? I'll talk No, no, no.
She already left for a meeting.
And I don't want you risking your job for me.
I'm sure Astro Taco will take me back.
Oh, man.
Jessica, will you call Dr.
Lerner and tell him I'm gonna be late? My car won't start.
I know a little bit about cars.
To Angel! To Angel.
To me! So you fixed Vanessa's car? Mm-hmm, and once I got it running, she was like, ""anyone who would get under a car in a skirt is worth taking a chance on.
"" How did you know how to do that? Oh, it was easy.
I just had to tune the solenoid so the drive gear meshed with the flywheel.
Anywho What is Vanessa like as a boss? Is she just all about the job or does she have a husband? No, no husband.
Really? Yeah, and personally, I think she might be a lesbian.
Nice.
Oh, that's me.
Oh, well, I really should be getting home.
You know, single mom and all.
What? Shh.
Hello? Have I gotten drunk and slept with a random guy yet? No one is going home until we dance.
Apple bottom jeans, jeans boots with the fur, with the fur the whole club was looking at her she hit the floor, she hit the floor next thing you know shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low them baggy sweatpants and the reeboks with the straps, with the straps she turned around and gave that big booty a smack she hit the floor, she hit the floor next thing you know shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low Go, Lee!

He better not even think about waking me up tonight for sex ophone lessons.
See, mom? I'm sure that's dad now.
That's not my phone.
Hello? Hey, Kat, it's me, a high school dude.
I was wondering if you wanna, like, interact on a social networking site.
And who is this? You are welcome.
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you! Mwah.
I don't care how much mom hates you.
I think you're awesome.
Okay, before you say anything, I got you something as well.
This is gorgeous.
How the hell did you pick it out? Look, I-I think that I lost sight of the fact that I'm not the only one this past year's been tough on.
Okay? And I am sorry if I've been neglecting you.
Look at that.
You figured it out.
I did.
Tonight, I'm taking you out.
Mm? Not to the bar.
Yeah, and Angel and Brian? Will be at least two tables away.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I almost forgot.
Look inside the bag.
There's more.
Ooh! ""A rainbow over Rwanda""? Spoiler alert she dies.
Just go strike up a conversation with her.
Okay.
I can do this.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm Angel.
Sarah.
I was hoping you'd come over.
Really? Well, in the case, can I just cut to the chase? Absolutely.
You have no visible panty lines.
How do you make that happen? I'm not wearing any underwear.
Yeah, that's not gonna work for me.",fail
15,We Are Men,"There are defining moments in life that change everything.
Excuse me, guys! Coming through! Not now! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sara, do you take Carter to be your husband? Do you promise to Don't marry him! I love you, Sara.
I will always love you.
Sorry.
Oh, I missed you.
Thank God you came.
This was my defining moment.
Losing love is like coming to terms with death.
You have to go through the five stages of grief.
Hey, everybody.
The bride-to-be just got a little case of cold feet.
She'll be back.
Let's party! Come on! - Denial.
- Hey, where you going? We're gonna do cake in a bit.
Anger.
Next comes bargaining.
One, no more video games; two, we'll go to your sister's art show; and three, I'll never accidentally do that thing in bed that we both know isn't an accident.
Okay, call me.
Then depression.
It is so good to have a man around the house again.
Who ate my hard-boiled egg? - Hmm? - Nobody ate it.
- Just - Well, I - Well, it's not there.
- It is behind - It's not there.
- No, it is behind the chicken.
I had to find someplace else to stay.
The brochure says it's ""quality, furnished short-term housing.
"" I'd say it's more like a way station for guys who just got divorced, dumped, or are otherwise incapable of buying their own couch.
Like Frank Russo, a successful clothing manufacturer.
After 16 years of marriage, he and his wife had grown apart.
I hate you! Are you insane?! But then Frank found true happiness with Lauren.
Then Stacy.
Then Jessica.
After his fourth divorce, Frank vowed the next time he found ""true happiness,"" he was just going to sleep with it for a few weeks.
Gil Bartis, small business owner.
Separated.
He and his wife were having trouble in the bedroom.
Okay.
We have 20 minutes.
Not now.
I'm bloated.
I had pizza for lunch.
That's okay, we can do it from the side.
I'll do all the work.
Oh, I don't want you to touch me.
Gil, I'm home! Oh, my God! His wife caught him having the world's worst affair.
He moved here temporarily until he could convince his wife to take him back.
That was a year and a half ago.
Yeah, she has nothing to do with the story.
I just thought she deserved a moment.
Well, she gave me chlamydia once.
See if she wants half of that back! Dr.
Stuart Weber.
Stuart fell madly in love with a young divorce attorney who, it turns out, was very good at her job.
Next time, he fell for a more spiritual woman, who, on their honeymoon in Paris, developed a taste for the material world and a distaste for her new husband.
Six months later, she hired the most ruthless lawyer in town.
But Stuart was smarter this time.
He's living here, hiding his assets until a settlement is reached.
Unfortunately, not all of his assets.
Truth is, after being here for a few weeks, I was feeling a little less lonely.
It was nice being around guys who knew what I was going through and could be sensitive to that.
She's a whore! Time to move on, son.
Where do you stand on Asian women? You guys don't get it.
It's not that easy for me.
Sara was the only girl I've ever been with.
One? - That's your total? - I'm offended by it.
I love it.
I'm not the low guy anymore.
We met freshman orientation week on a Welcome to College hayride.
What was I supposed to do? A junior year abroad? Semester at sea? Internship at American Apparel? These are just ideas.
This is a blessing.
You are a free man now.
You can finally live.
We are taking you under our wing.
- We did the same thing for Gil.
- I was here before you.
But you didn't use your time well.
Carter, look around you.
You're living in paradise.
We got a killer gym.
We got indoor parking.
We got complimentary Sunday brunch.
And we are four exits from Hollywood.
""Actresses"" come through here all the time.
Enter Frank stage left.
And Stuart stage right.
Yeah, just to be clear, different actresses, different stages.
All very kosher.
Then I stupidly went on her Facebook page, and there were all these pictures of her - with that guy.
- Why? Why would you do that? So you could feel bad about yourself? You go on your wife's Facebook page all the time.
And I feel bad about myself.
I just have too much time on my hands.
I mean, I don't even have a job anymore.
I was working for her dad.
He fired you? This is a family of animals! It would've been awkward anyway.
Besides, marketing industrial paint is even more boring than it sounds.
So, wait, what are you gonna do? I have no idea.
- Come on, dig deep.
- Well, I I guess I've always really wanted to coach basketball.
There you go.
We used to break into my grade school gym and play all the time.
The other guys, they wanted to be Jordan, I wanted to be Pat Riley.
I even had a little suit.
So what made you hang up the tiny three-piece? Sara.
She didn't even let me watch basketball.
You want to coach? That's easy.
I know the athletic director over at Emerson High.
They won city four years in a row.
Y you'd put in a call for me? Yeah, I delivered all three of his chubby, ugly girls.
He's like family.
Done.
Okay, enough chitchat.
It's time to get young Carter here back on the horse.
Help you forget all about Susan.
- Sara.
- You're not even trying.
Come on.
I don't know, uh she's pretty cute, I guess.
Hey, don't look at her! Are you kidding? Okay.
No, no.
You're right.
Crawl before you walk.
Go.
What am I supposed to do? Just walk over there and talk to her? That's It's a numbers game.
You hit on ten women, get slapped nine times, but one'll say yes.
Dare to be great.
Go.
- Get there! - Go.
There you go.
Hey.
Adds danger.
There he goes.
Here he comes.
Wow, he didn't even break stride.
The next night, the lions were back at the watering hole.
Frank's words, not mine.
Unbelievable.
How does he get a girl like that to even give him the time of day? Charm.
Confidence.
And that's his daughter.
- Hey.
Hey, Abby.
- Hey.
Hey, guys.
I'm sorry, I'm so bad with names.
No, they're easy to forget.
That's Gil Stuart and that's the new guy, Carter.
His bride just dumped him at the altar.
Do you have to lead with that? It's really your defining characteristic right now.
That's terrible.
I'm so sorry.
You hear that? You're getting sympathy.
We're going to be able to - work with that.
- Yeah, totally.
Women love a fixer-upper.
So, Abby, what brings you here? Well, I went to the Lakers game with some friends from work.
Let me guess.
Classic fourth-quarter meltdown.
11 unanswered points.
They've got no bench.
And a bad coach.
But hey, at least you can pay 20 bucks for a cucumber roll, right? Uh, anyway, I should probably get back to my friends.
It was really nice to meet you, and, yeah, I'll see you guys later.
Bye, Abby.
No.
No.
No.
Maybe.
No.
This this is what I've been missing.
I was with Sara for so long going to farmer's markets and dinner parties I lost touch with my guy friends.
Who's got the ketchup? Did you eat all the ketchup? We never went out Saturday night because we always woke up early Sunday morning to buy organic produce.
Now who the hell knows what I'm putting in my stomach? Food of the gods, baby.
Just keep it off the upholstery.
I'm taking off my shirt! Pass it back here.
I got to mop up this shake.
Come on, this is a lease, ladies and gentlemen.
We are not letting this night end.
Who wants to break into a Catholic school? Yeah! I am a giant terrorizing the village! - He's unstoppable.
- Okay, switch it up.
Come on.
Pick and roll, Gil.
Pick and roll.
I already told you, I don't know what that means.
All right, new guy, you and me.
Whoa! No fair! I'm wearing loafers! No, no, no, no, no.
Carter, you're a genius.
We should play children's basketball every night! Oh, nun! Nun! Let's boogie! Is she chasing us?! - Is she chasing us?! - No, Gil! - Don't use my name! - Why are we running?! Because it's awesome! I'm just gonna say it.
I love you guys.
I know you think I'm drunk, and I am, but I do.
I love you guys.
Can I say that? No, I'm not comfortable with that.
Oh, loosen up, Stu.
We're men, and we love each other.
Band of Brothers! - Celebrate it.
- We're men, and we love each other! Yeah! After a modest donation to the Sisters of St.
Joseph and a good night's sleep I felt like I was finally ready to put myself out there.
Ah, Carter.
Hey, there you are.
What an unusual shirt.
This is my new friend May Hi and her daughter Jill.
- Hi.
- She's a sure thing.
Dare to be great.
Come on.
Let's, uh let's let these two get to know each other, shall we? Hi.
I need to borrow Carter for a minute.
We'll be right back.
Frank's insane.
You're not going home with Mrs.
Robinson-San.
You are going home with Amber, this is Carter.
Carter, Amber.
Stuart told me your fiancée died.
You poor thing.
Let me buy you a drink.
Rock climbing accident.
You're welcome.
Hi.
Hi.
The next morning, I was hungover and feeling like things were going a little too fast.
- How'd it go with Amber? - Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
You didn't go home with May? Oh, my God.
I slept with her daughter for nothing.
I didn't go home with anyone, all right? We had, uh, a few drinks.
I don't know, the whole time, I'm thinking, ""What am I doing with this girl I have I have nothing in common with?"" I miss Sara.
We've already got a Gil.
We don't need another Gil.
Look, this is hard for me, okay? I lost everything.
Sara and I, you know, we just bought a house.
We were gonna have kids.
You know, I had a life, and now, I'm living in temporary housing in Tarzana.
You know what I think? I think you're scared.
You have had one girlfriend, one job you hate, never lived on your own.
I wouldn't be so quick to call that a life.
Oh, it's life, all right.
Sara's life.
Look, I I don't want to talk about this, all right? We're our situations are different.
Hang on.
What's that supposed to mean? Nothing.
I've just got to try and figure this whole thing out.
I don't want to end up here, you know, five years from now, desperate and sad.
So we're desperate and sad? - That's not what I meant.
- What did you meant? Okay, do you really want to do this? Come on, Stuart.
You're so angry at your ex-wives, you can't move on.
And, Gil You don't have to go down the line.
Okay, then I won't say that you're obviously holding on to something that is not there anymore.
- Thank you.
- And, Frank - Hit me! - Do you honestly think that you're gonna have a meaningful relationship with some random 25-year-old that you meet at a Jamba Juice? Is she Asian? Let's get out of here.
We've obviously been wasting our I'll save you the trouble.
You are no longer under our wing.
Wow, you're even good at the ten-foot baskets.
Yeah, I played all four years at UC San Diego.
It was D2, but you know.
I, uh, I got cut from my intramural team and replaced by a really good Norwegian girl from the dental school.
- Yeah? - Really good.
Uh, I'm really sorry.
Yeah, I shouldn't have said all that stuff and No, look, don't worry about it.
You were actually absolutely right about those two, you know? Here.
Oh, my God, are you okay? That was my bad.
I don't know why I called for it.
- Yeah.
- Uh, you really want to get back with Sara, right? I know that look.
I do, yeah, even after everything.
When I screwed up my marriage which I regret every waking minute I thought the best thing to do would be to sort of give my wife a lot of space, you know? Wait for her to forgive me, and see Were you gonna tell me my nose is bleeding? I wanted to hear what you had to say.
Sorry.
The thing is, man, I waited too long.
Now I can only see her when I pick up my daughter.
If you love Sara, don't just sit around doing nothing.
Some guy made some big grand gesture guess what? - It's your turn.
- Yeah.
- Go out there and get her.
- I will.
Thank you.
Want me to get you an ice pack or something? Oh, no, I'm just gonna go jump in the pool.
Okay.
I wasn't gonna let that other defining moment define me.
Where the hell is he? Carter, what are you doing here? Fighting for my woman.
Carter You and me, jackass, right now! We broke up two weeks ago.
Oh, thank God.
I didn't want to say anything, but I bonked my elbow on the way in here.
I have been dying to call you, but I was so ashamed.
I I'm sorry.
I I panicked.
And you probably hate me, and I don't blame you, but being away from you has made me realize that I never want to be away from you again.
I knew I wasn't like those other guys, who at that moment, were back at the apartments.
Gil was on a date with a lovely young lady.
Dad, you know, Fiona's mom would totally go out with you.
I'm not interested.
Honey, any day now, your mother and I are, um You know what? Why not? I'll ask her to lunch.
Great.
She's super nice and has really big boobs.
Or dinner.
Stuart was negotiating the terms of his divorce.
No, no, no, no, I'm not giving her crap! I don't care if we're in court for a thousand years! You tell my first crazy, evil wife to tell my second crazy, evil wife ! Fine, let her have the Dodgers tickets.
But I'm not giving her the parking pass! And Frank was having a rare moment of introspection.
How old are you anyway? 26.
Why? No reason.
My old life was back.
Oh! How are you so good at this? I date young women.
We don't have that much to talk about.
Hey, guys.
This is Sara.
- Oh.
Hello.
- Hey.
Uh, look, I know we haven't spoken since the other day No need to apologize; you were dead-on about these two.
So, seems like things are going well.
Yeah, actually, the wedding is back on.
Uh, we just came back to get my stuff, so That's great, man, you know? Mention me in the vows, don't mention me in the vows.
Totally up to you, obviously.
You should mention me in the vows.
The country club had a cancellation.
We're getting married next Saturday.
Great.
Maybe this time, you'll make it all the way through the ceremony.
They worked it out, Stu.
Hey, you guys should come.
I'd love that.
Let me check with Mom to see if there's any wiggle room - on the guest list.
- Okay.
So nice to meet you.
I'm gonna go finish packing up the car, okay? - Okay.
- I love you.
Love you.
I'm happy for you.
I pictured her fatter.
I've been meaning to call you.
My guy over at Emerson High wants you to come in for that basketball interview next week.
You're kidding me.
Yeah.
They need a new JV coach, and it sounds like it's yours to lose.
That's huge! Thank you! I'll call him this afternoon.
Better dust off that tiny suit.
What about Sara? Is she gonna be okay with that? Yeah, we had a long talk, and things are gonna be different from now on.
Anyway, I should get going.
We're meeting another couple over at the farmer's market.
It's a give-and-take.
Don't want to be late for that.
The white nectarines go fast.
You joke, but they do.
Well, here we are, back where we started.
renting a tuxedo twice is still cheaper than buying one.
Although, this can't happen again.
Hey, Carter should be getting married right about now.
Are you buying Sara didn't invite us because there wasn't enough room at the church? It's possible.
The Episcopalians run a tight ship.
Hey, guys, listen to this.
I just got off the phone with my buddy.
Oh, God! There's a reason that thing comes with a belt! Carter blew off his coaching interview.
- What?! - He said he already had a job, with his father-in-law, selling paint.
You know what this means.
He's under her wing again.
And her wing is more of a thumb.
Shakespeare.
Let's make a pact.
We promise we won't let any of us get into another crappy marriage.
And yes, Gil, we know, yours isn't crappy, it's wonderful.
Well, look, we have our issues.
Just speaking the truth before it's too late.
Band of Brothers.
Band of Brothers.
Sara, do you take Carter to be your husband? Do you promise to be true to him in good times and in bad? Don't do it! How many ex-boyfriends do you have? Not her.
We're here for him.
Oy.
Everyone's staring at us.
- I know.
Say something.
- Yeah, well, I told you, we should've written stuff down.
Yeah, well, I thought we'd just wing it.
Hi.
Frank Russo.
Carter, what's going on? I don't know.
Hey, guys? We're kind of in the middle of something here.
Yeah, um, our timing really could have been better, but, uh a are you sure this is what you want? We know you skipped out on your coaching interview.
Who cares? Stop it! - They're ruining our wedding! - I guess they're just, you know, making sure I'm doing the right thing.
Do you have concerns? No! No, I don't have concerns.
- I have concerns.
- Carter, I wish someone had done this for me on the day of my first, second and fourth weddings.
Not the third.
She was a shot of life.
And for what it's worth, I was noticing, there's actually plenty of room in here.
Oh, my God! - Kick them out already! - I will.
I I will.
It's just they might have a point.
What?! I mean I don't want to be a paint salesman my whole life.
I want to coach basketball.
This again? Are you kidding me? Somehow I always let you talk me out of it.
We're getting married, and I I need to know that you love me for me, and not some guy you want me to be.
It is like you have been brainwashed by these idiots that you've only known for two months.
These ""idiots"" seem to get me more than you do.
Just so you know, the acoustics are very good in here.
You are being ridiculous.
Do you really want to throw your life away? No.
I don't.
In case you're keeping track, that look on my face is acceptance.
Why are we running?! Because it's awesome! Red bathing suit, two o'clock.
Big guy with the hairy back? All right, more like, uh, two-thirty, quarter to three.
No, too young.
Even I have scruples.
She already shot you down? She was civil about it.
Look, I know I haven't said it, but, um thanks for you know.
Band of Brothers, baby.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Carter, right? Yeah.
You remembered.
Let me just get some clothes on, and we'll go eat.
Sure.
'Kay.
- Bye.
- See ya.
No.",fail

Okay, here we go.
What is that? The glueitzer.
Jeez.
How is that portable? Because I'm carrying it.
Plus, the glue is unbelievable.
You can stick an elephant to the ceiling.
It would stay there.
Okay, okay, okay.
Don't don't point that at me.
And and don't get any glue on my car, okay? I'm not gonna get glue on your car.
Take a chill pill, baby.
Testicles.
What? What are testicles? Testicles? No, no.
The answer's not testicles.
Anybody else? Anybody at all? Somebody say something.
Paul? Huh? Testicles are acceptable.
Really? Okay.
The judges tell me they will accept testicles.
Yeah! Okay.
Good for you.
You get it wrong, but still you win.
Isn't that something? Paul, that is brilliant.
Legs, legs.
A man has two, a stallion has four legs.
A horse doesn't have four testicles.
But testicles is funnier, Paul.
Funnier testicles Okay, you know what? Now I'm losing my mind.
I'm literally The mind is going away now.
Paul, Paul, you're perfect for this.
Oh, no, I'm not.
Trust me.
You know who would be great? Larry David would be perfect for this.
Honestly, Larry's not that likable.
How am I likable? I yelled at the contestants.
Yeah, but you felt bad doing it.
What's funny for the audience at home is you squirming.
Your misery is the funny part.
Excuse me, Mr.
Burnett? Oh, I got it.
Listen, you're brilliant.
It's gonna work.
Won't work, never gonna work.
Listen, we're gonna talk.
We're talking.
Okay, you can work, but not with me.
Don't talk.
No, I don't want you guys to Don't talk to him.
Are you what? So you're calling me a bad father? Oh, no.
No, you made me a bad father.
My kid is in tears right now because you saddled us with a deadbeat state.
If it's any consolation, I think you're both bad fathers.
This is gonna be a thing of beauty.
Hey, hey, you didn't get any glue on my car, did you? Trying to help you here.
Why are we bad fathers? 'Cause this is the kids' homework, not yours.
Hey, hey, hey, I saw you scoring amish wagon wheels for your kid.
And I hate myself for it.
I don't want to do their homework, and you know why? Uh, because you're lazy? 'Cause it's wrong.
It's cheating.
I already graduated fourth grade With honors, by the way.
Congratulations.
I'm just saying, our dads never did our homework.
And we're better men for it.
Are we? Really? Hmm.
Done! Take a look at that.
Who's your hoosier now, baby? Yeah, anybody can do Indiana.
This is fantastic! Thank you! It's my pleasure.
Just keep it away from open flames, uh And birds.
The fumes make them crazy.
I don't know why.
Okay, okay.
You the man, you the man! My pleasure.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
This is fantastic.
Habib, you are the greatest.
Hey, come here.
Give me a hug.
Oh, that's okay.
Come here, you big nut.
Give me a hug.
Why don't you come here and hug me, huh? Come on! Eh! Come to daddy-bear.
What? Did you glue your ass to my car? Not on purpose.
Are you kidding me? In time, you'll make it your own.
I don't want it to be my own.
You bring such an edgy freshness to it.
That doesn't even mean any Edgy freshness, what the Okay, that's my son.
I got to take this.
Hey, buddy, what's up? Hmm.
He's fine.
Stupid Russian glue.
We need to call the army.
Hey! Hey! So What's the good news? Did you get the job? I got it.
Of course you did.
Nice.
Beautiful.
All right, buddy.
Good for you.
But I'm not doing it.
Thank God! You would've hated it.
What, you turned it down? Yeah.
And you want to know why? Because you're lazy? No.
I just got a call from zekey.
He ran over his friend's stapler.
I told him, ""well, just apologize.
""You know, sometimes friends fight.
""And if he's really your friend, it'll all work out, I promise.
"" I am sorry about before.
Nah, hey, hey.
I'm sorry about Delaware.
Oh, no, no, that's fine.
The important thing is I got it done in plenty of time.
Say what? Can I finish my story? Oh, you weren't finished? So he calls me now to tell me the other kid just invited him to his birthday party.
Aw! Well, that's nice.
Not finished.
Really? Still? And then I'm not bragging He says to me, ""you were right, daddy.
"" Okay? How about that? You know what? That's what I'm putting on a damn form.
What form? ""Father's occupation Father.
"" That's my job.
I love my job.
""You were right, daddy"" Come on.
What, do I need more than that? Mm, mm, mm.
Right.
Okay.
I feel guilty now.
I guess I need to go home and kiss my kid.
Are you happy? What are you talking about Hey, hey, hey, there's a game show for you.
You know, you get a group of dads.
They already feel pretty bad about themselves, and then you come out, and you kick them.
What do you mean, kick? I would how No, it's just terrific.
I mean, who wouldn't watch that? What I was just I wasn't trying to make you guys feel bad.
I was just I was Making yourself look better in comparison.
We understand.
No, how No, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, fellas, fellas.
Just so this never happens again.
This is not a story you tell to men.
We talk about our kids all the time.
How is that what did I do? Individually, maybe.
But as a group, no.
It becomes Oprah, really.
Well, I'm sorry if I offended by sharing something very sweet.
It's okay.
We understand.
He's a little self-satisfied.
But, uh, on the plus side, he's not doing the game show.
He's not selling his soul like a dancing monkey.
And we can applaud that.
Well, there you go.
Yes, good for you.
I'm proud of you, buddy.
Well, thank you.
Come here.
I got to give it up.
That takes guts.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Way to go, really.
Yeah? Yes, absolutely.
All right, I'll take it.
Habib Give him a hug.
No, I'm I'm okay.
He's okay.
No, it's all right.
Aren't you happy for him? Yeah.

You know what? A little too much happy.
Okay.
All right, all right.
I get it.
I get it.
You're happy! Okay, all right.
You're happy.
Stop happy.
- Honest to God, I thought - What did you think? You want to know what I thought? - What? - Honest to God? I thought you were gonna tell me that you were gay, that you were out of the closet, that you're a gay man.
And that's what I thought.
And I thought, ""well, why's he telling me? ""Why's he gonna tell me? ""'Cause he must think I'm gay too, ""that I'd be a good person to tell.
""Why does he think I'm gay? ""Wwwhat's it about me that makes him think that I'm gay? Am I particularly effeminate?"" And I thought, ""oh, my God, this guy he's gay.
He's gonna tell me he's gay.
"" That's what I thought.
Really? Yes.
I mean, 'cause a lot of people always say to me, ""you know, Paul"" No, not that anybody says it.
Yeah.
But my own observation of you, you talk about a lot of feminine subjects all the time.
- Do I? Really? - Yes, you do.
I've got a high voice too.
Right there, yeah.
But not always.
Yeah, you kind of talk high.
So I And so from that, you got, ""oh, Paul's"" I don't know.
I just got nervous.
I got nervous.
""Why why's he telling me? What does he want from me? Why's he gonna call me and tell me?"" You know? I would think you would be relieved now that it's much less of a dramatic thing.
I just had a simple business question.
I am a little relieved.
Would this have been a better lunch for you if I told you, ""Larry, I'm gay, and I find you appealing?"" It would've it would've been more interesting.
Really? Yeah.",fail
17,Emily's Reasons Why Not,"so that's me, emily sanders, editor of self-help books, whose advice I never seem to follow.
But sometimes my mind drifts back to a time when I practiced my own form of self-help-- a time when the reasons why not were much more clear to me.
Sixth grade--post-braces, pre-training bra.
Psst! emily.
Ever tried one? I stole 'em from my mom.
Want one? Reason why not to smoke give grandma a k-- no,thanks.
And for the most part, I was pretty good at listening to the reasons why not hey! That is,until my hormones kicked in.
that means you're my lady.
Mark ponzio-- rude,aggressive,head lice.
But I went to the sixth grade dance with him anyway, and frankly, it's been nothing but ponzios ever since.
There were always plenty of reasons not to get involved with reese callahan, but I wanted him to be right thanks.
So I just ignored everything that was wrong.
Bye.
hey,reese, you forgot your cell pne! two cell phones? Yeah,there could be a perfectly good reason for him to have two cell phones like,for example, Oh,that one's me.
I finally had to admit it was over.
I was done making excuses for inexcusable behavior, and now I had to do something mature, positive and healing.
Hi.
I'm reese.
I have two cell phones.
I suck! I'm a loser! Take this.
Ha ha! 2-faced man-person.
Do you feel better now? -Kinda.
-I'll bet.
Why did I go out with that guy? Whdidn't I listen to the reasons? Well,'cause he was cute and smart and successful, anyour man-person instincts really suck.
So consider this the wake-up call,mama.
Look,I had to hit rock bottom before I cleansed myself of unworthy men and found my beloved aknad.
Oh,please.
Monogamy is overrated.
No,no,I want a soul mate.
I want an aknad.
From now on,I'm gonna listen to the reasons.
Five reasons why not to date a guy, and he's history, even if the perfect male specimen comes a-knockin'.
Hi.
I'm stan from marketing.
They hired the perfect male specimen in marketing? Do you,uh,feel like going to grab some lunch? Emily,no.
You're on the rebound.
You're slightly hungover.
Only last night, you were practicing voodoo.
Plus you already had a sizeable mid-morning snack.
I'll just grab my shag.
I mean,my bag.
I meant to say ""my bag.
"" Duh.
So silly.
that's okay.
-Hello.
-Hi.
How you doing? Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
That's it.
I'm brewing you a special ""keep your panties on"" infusion.
Would yoplease talk to her? I'm gonna need a few more details before I judge her, and judge her harshly.
You guys,this guy is different.
Not only did he pull out my chair when I t down not only did he independently order and pour me mineral water but he kept his eyes locked on me -even though-- -even though what? Even though our waitress was like this hot latina porn star.
I mean,reese would have been all over her.
good afternoon.
You like I tell to you the specials? She asked him if he wanted to know the specials, and he said uh,no,thanks.
And? And then what happened? And then we both had a salad and we shared a dessert.
Oh.
Honey,you've set the bar so low.
Don't you guys understand? The universe sent me stan from marketing 'cause he's the polar opposite of reese.
And the best part is, there's not a ""reason why not"" in sight.
too young, too close,too fast too much time spent living in the past too tired,too scared too much to do for sure,no doubt not into you why ask why? I ask,""why not?"" I ask,""why not?"" Emilys Reasons Why Not Season 01Episode 01 Proudly Presents Oh,stan.
new beau? Already? Glitter cho-- My backstabbing former assistant who once stole an idea of mine to land herself a promotion.
Pure evil.
Not to be trusted.
Is this the mock-up for reese's book jacket? ""Hook,lie & sinker: The lies men tell women.
The lies women tell themselves.
"" What am I,an idiot? Yep.
He wrote the book on manipulating women, and you published it.
It must be hard working with him after the way he treated you.
You know,I work with people I don't like all the time,glitter.
I took the liberty of selecting the best shot.
Still needs to be retouched,though.
I don't know.
Part of me thinks it's better to let Mr.
Callahan's flaws be known.
But that's just because you're bitter and still reeling from rejection.
You know what? I don't like this shot.
Why don't you run over the contact sheet, and I'll tell you which one I wanna see enlarged.
That way,we won't waste any more of the company's resources.
Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi.
You got the,uh mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Okay.
I just wanted-- mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Kudos,em.
Stan from marketing-- he really is a dish.
just don't drop the ball.
You never know who might be waiting in the wings.
And suddenly it was clear to me.
The glitter chos of the world would always try to take what belonged to the emily sanders of the world, including their stans from marketing.
But if stan is my soul mate-- and who knows? Maybe he could be-- my only job is to listen to my instincts, watch out for any reasons why not and see what develops.
Nice! Come on.
One per customer.
Well one is all anyone can ask for.
um,wait.
No.
Can I have,uh,that one right there? This one? It's a little to the left.
That one.
thank you.
thank you.
So cute.
I gravitate toward the rejects.
Hey.
I mean,obviously I don't mean you.
You know,all the girls in the office have the hots for you.
Yeah? Well, I'm only interested in one.
Is this the one? Yeah,that's her.
That's her.
The one with the wonky eye.
Eyelash.
Please,eyelash.
Please let stan be as good as he looks.
Let him not be a player, a stalker or a kinky pervert who lives vicariously through an internet alter ego.
And while you're at it,eyelas please let glitter cho be eaten by a shark.
Morning.
Useless sharks.
Okay,so I'm no genius, but you,stan,both absent from reese callahan's book party last night? Very naughty.
You know,glitter,I'm just his editor.
My job's done.
The press events really have nothing to do with me.
So is he a good kisser? Reese? Stan.
Oh.
I don't know yet.
You mean, he hasn't kissed you? Your new boyfriend hasn't kissed you? okay,I wasn't even thinking about the fact that he hadn't kissed me, but now I am.
Hey.
Whoa.
Hey.
Watch out there.
You'll bruise my bok choy.
okay,dinner is a nobel cause, and the stir-fry smells fantastic, but why is this man trying to avoid kissing me? ah,okay.
That was kinda like a kiss from a mime.
look how sweet he's being.
Reese never would have cooked me dinner, and I'm a confident woman.
I don't need physical intimacy to make me feel attractive usually.
em I just wanna properly thank you for dinner.
Let's not do something we're not ready for,okay? Don't you wanna spend the night? Uh,of course I do.
Can't we just,um cuddle? Cuddle? cuddle? Did I mention that stan is a black belt in brazilian jujitsu? How sexy is that? Come here.
There.
See? Isn't this nice? Yeah,it is,actually.
Aren't we snuggly? Yeah,we are.
Well,good night.
Reason why not number one-- when he says he wants to sleep with you, he means he wants to sleep with you.
it loss of bowel control? Please.
Have you two been living under a rock? It's bronzer.
Self-tanning solution.
He's doing the fake and bake.
You mean he wears makeup? Stan wears makeup? So? Most of the guys I know wear makeup.
okay,I see your point.
Reason why not number two He wears make-up.
emily,is this your bag? Oh,no,that's stan's gym bag.
Really? I wonder what's in there.
Like,I don't know,scooby,but we're about to find out.
Please,eyelash, please don't let there be anything incriminating in stan's gym bag.
Let it just be stinky,sweaty gym clothes.
Thank god! Wait a minute.
""Martha stewart living""? He has a subscription to ""martha stewart living.
"" Holy implied homosexuality.
Reason why not number three Martha.
Stewart.
Subscription.
he just doesn't seem gay.
I didn't seem gay before I came out.
-yeah,you did.
-yeah,you did.
Maybe stan is just shy.
Even so,I'm only up to three reasons, so he's still in the game,right? Kitten, if your boyfriend's gay, that's the only reason you need.
Hello! The best sex I ever had was with a gay guy trying to prove he wasn't.
He kept trying to prove it hour after hour after hour after hour.
Well,that's not me,okay? I am through getting involved with guys who are not available.
I still think you guys look so cute together.
You know,I decided it's just not professional to get involved with the authors that we publish.
You're right.
It's far more professional to sleep with the men in our marketing division.
I could take her.
I could kick her ass.
Don't be mad? Bite me.
I just thought you two should make peace, for the sake of the book.
The book is done, and this chapter's closed.
I'll let the rest of the office know that the two of you are not to be disturbed.
Emily reese,don't.
I'm just starting to feel human again.
I miss you,em.
I really miss you.
And that's when I felt it-- the ""flutter flutter,"" that light,ticklish feeling that is the barometer of all chemical attraction.
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.
""Was""? Why are you using the past tense? Know how you used to always tell me I never did anything thoughtful for you? Yeah.
I brought you a present.
You did? Yeah.
If you don't have the ""flutter flutter,"" you don't have nothin'.
a bird.
It's a lovebird.
Aren't there supposed to be two of them? Exactly.
Who's this? Stan,my boyfriend.
It's really serious.
He works in this office,actually, and he is an expert in a little martial art I like to call brazilian jujitsu.
brazilian jujitsu? that's like the gayest sport there is! whee-a! Reason why not number four Brazilian Jujitsu.
It's like the Gayest sport there is .
that is very gay behavior.
And I thought I was gay.
I'm struck by how gay this display of gayness is.
Aknad? That man is a very gay man.
Very gay indeed.
reason why not number five If your gay friend thisks he's gay He must be gay.
as I watched stan roll around with bruce, his sparring partner, the evidence was mounting in the most literal sense of the word.
Well,at least now we know why he didn't wanna sleep with you.
Why did he even bother with me? I mean,why didn't he just come right out and admit it? I think he just did.
Here he comes,here he comes.
Hey,glad you guys could make it.
So? What do you guys think,huh? Did you win? Oh,yeah.
I tapped him in,like,ten seconds.
I love it when they submit.
Yeah,so what do you guys think,huh? You know,if you're interested, I can introduce you to my instructor.
Well,it certainly seems like great exercise.
Aknad? You know,I think we'd be naturals.
Yes.
Good.
After seeing stan in action, the coffin of gayness was pretty much nailed shut.
The answer was obvious.
Stan can stay in the closet, but he can't stay my boyfriend.
The sooner I handled it,the better.
Hi.
This is stan from marketing.
I'm either on another call or away from my desk.
Please leave a message,and I will get back to you.
Hey,stan,it's emily.
I started talking, and I just didn't stop, which directly resulted in my outing stan on the company voice mail.
That's it.
Bye.
I know a secret about your boyfriend.
Is that a bird? yes,and reese is not my boyfriend,glitter.
Not reese.
Stan.
I met one of his eight sisters last night, and guess what she told me.
That he's gay.
Gay? No.
He's not gay.
He's a virgin! What? Virgin.
They're frickin' mormons.
Mormons.
Is that a crack up or what? He can't be a mormon.
He's gay.
He subscribes to ""martha stewart.
"" Well,he is in publishing.
And he wrestles bruce.
I think it's great.
The big,hunky,sexy virgin who wants to wait until he's married to do it? Mmm,I am all over that.
he's not gay,he's not gay! Maybe I can figure out his secret code.
Maybe I can erase the message from his voice mail.
Maybe I can blow up the whole phone system.
Of course,that would only work if he hadn't listened to his message yet.
Hey,stan.
It's emily.
I just wanted to talk to you about your sexuality.
actually,your homosexuality.
I mean,you may not want to discuss this, but it's kinda hard for me to ignore based on our total lack of a sex life.
My best friend josh-- also gay-- he says his life did not even start until he came out of the closet, so good luck with all the guys that you can start going out with now, and I'm sorry it's not me.
Bye.
so thai food for lunch? Sweetie,eat something.
You'll feel better.
Trust me,I won't.
I'm not hungry.
In fact,I'm considering having my big mouth wired shut.
And you're sure he got the message? Oh,he got the message.
He got the message loud and clear.
So what'd he do? So then I pushed him into the utility closet, and he barely even looks at me.
I need to talk to you.
So talk.
It figured.
He was wearing my favorite sweater.
Ironically,it was virgin wool.
Hey, don't touch me.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
No,you didn't, but that didn't stop you from passing judgment,did it? He was saying I was being really judgmental, which is weird,'cause aren't his people supposed to be more forgiving? -That is true.
-Oh,yeah,totaY.
They are.
Anyway,I didn't know what to say, so I basically said josh is the one who said what? Ehe said you were totally gay.
You blamed me? How fourth grade is that? Well,it's true.
You told me he was gay, and you said that you were the expert.
He blipped on the gaydar.
I'd never met a straight male virgin before.
Frankly,I didn't know there were any.
Yeah,but stan is more than just a virgin.
He's a latter-day saint.
Well,I'm not mormon material.
And even though stan's not actually gay, maybe he still wasn't the right guy for me.
Maybe that's what the reasons why not were trying to tell me.
At least it didn't take six months and a looming bladder infection to figure it out.
Well,that's progress,right? Yes,finally.
Oh,my god.
Can you steal that guy's paper? I think there's a thing on reese's book.
Oh,sure.
Ahem.
Oh,yeah.
It's not on the front page.
Oh,right,hang on.
There we go.
""Dastardly delicious""! Aah! Emily,congratulations.
-That is so awesome.
-Oh,my god.
See? Something good did come out of my relationship with reese.
Cheers.
-I'll be right back.
-This is such a great review.
All right,see you later.
So my initial instincts about men may not be as sharp as my initial instincts about books, but I guess that's what makes my life interesting.
And frankly, I'm still optimistic that the reasons why not will lead me to what I'm looking for.
As much as I want to find my other half, I need to consider the possibility that maybe I'm already whole.
But that's the thing about possibilities-- they're infinite.

You know what I'm talking about, don't you? Yeah, I do.
Amy: So anyway, you give it an eyeball, maybe ballpark diagnosis? Why don't you just come into my office? - Just make an appointment.
- Oh.
Okay.
That's cool.
Um, I am currently in between insurance carriers, so what's your barter policy? (Amy laughs) (laughing): Just messing with you! I'll pay cash.
It'll probably be all ones.
And no, I'm not a stripper, Brad.
Damn it.
So, Dr.
Allison, I guess I'll be seeing you soon, huh? Amy: And, you I'm not done with you yet.
Good.
If you need me, I live above my sister's garage.
- Ooh, you're a project, aren't you? - Get your tool set ready.
(chuckles) Why was I flirting with that woman? I have no idea.
She's some kook from the farmers' market.
It's like she drew me in it got very sexual, very quickly.
- Yeah, I know.
It was weird.
- All right.
Ta-da! - I told you I'd see you soon.
- Okay, uh, you keep showing up everywhere, - and it's freaking me out.
- Absolutely.
It is weird.
Creme de menthe? I'm actually on my way back to the office.
'Cause it's 2:00 p.
m.
, on a Tuesday.
Wow, it's Tuesday already? Man, space and time! - Listen, can I ask you something personal? - I don't really know you.
Do you believe there's a force in this world that wants nothing more - than for you to be happy? - But go ahead and ask anyway.
And if there was such a force, do you think it could be manifested in a person? A person whose mission is to safeguard your journey through this world? You know, like, uh, intervene before you get hit by a bus or something like that.
It sounds like you're describing a guardian angel.
That's exactly what I'm describing.
(big sigh) What exactly do you want? (sighs) Dr.
Allison, we have not been formally introduced.
I'm Amy, and, honey I'm your guardian angel.
Uh look - I am a skin doctor.
- I know.
I think what you need is a psychiatrist.
- Oh.
- Or maybe a sober living arrangement.
Your mother died 412 days ago.
And though you won't admit it, she was your best friend.
And since then you've buried yourself in work, buried yourself in a relationship with a guy who's a bit of a tool.
- Hey - It's an observation, honey, it's not a judgment.
Got your first period at Red Lobster, which is super ironic.
(quietly): Stop! (women laughing) Remember your first orgasm, when you farted just a little bit? Oh, my God! (laughing) Oh, man, so embarrassing! How do you know all that stuff? I've been watching you.
It's what we do.
We watch over souls.
And yours is amazing.
You could've easily found that stuff online.
My friends over-share on Facebook.
That's true, and I am a whiz at the computer Especially Photoshop.
Check this out my head on Gisele Bundchen's body.
- What do you think? - Ew.
Christmas card material? No? So you've been cyber-stalking me? - I suppose you know my password? - Maybe.
Or I may be an angel whose mission it is to safeguard your journey through this world.
It all depends on what you believe, Allison.
Okay.
See you later, angel lady.
Yeah.
Okay.
Look out! Bus! Oh, my God! (gasps) No, no, no bus.
I'm so sorry.
I'm seeing things.
My fault.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.
No touching, either.
(laughing): I'm buzzed.
I thought I saw a bus.
I'm loaded.
It's the creme de menthe, honey.
It sneaks up on ya.
S01E01 Pilot - Morning, Felicia.
- Holy sunburn, Dad! How many days were you lost in the desert? - I played a quick nine this morning.
- Aw, Dad, come on, we're dermatologists, not cautionary tales.
Hey, you know, I still haven't received your RSVP to the housewarming party.
I think your house is plenty warm.
Is it really necessary to add an unemployed boyfriend, honey? Evan and I are moving in together, it is happening, and I want you there.
Of course I'm coming.
Great.
Are you bringing anyone? No, no.
Flying solo like a golden eagle.
You know who you could bring? Uh, Dana from the club.
Yeah, she seems cool.
- She's too short.
- Have you seen yourself lately? Exactly.
If we had kids, they'd be jockeys.
Oh, what about that cute pediatrician from the conference? Oh, I'll date a doctor if you do.
Dad, come on, it's been over a year since Mom died.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
But it might be time to get out there.
Are you nervous? 'Cause you're a Beverly Hills skin doctor.
There's going to be a stampede.
Well, now you're making me blush.
I wish I could tell.
Stacy from the bank.
And we're done.
If you'll excuse me now, I'm gonna go dunk my head in some aloe.
(car alarm chirps) Sweet Volt.
Evan's idea? You know what they say about a guy with a small carbon footprint small penis.
Okay, we're officially in a stalker situation.
Impromptu plan you, me, Julio's Cantina.
When's the last time you had a weekday margarita? No, thanks.
I've got a 6:00 a.
m.
spin class.
Plus, I'm off sugar.
(groans) I have an antihistamine or EpiPen here somewhere, - 'Cause I'm allergic to fun.
- Because you're allergic to fun.
Listen I know we just met and we're having a great time making jokes, but I have something really intense I need to talk to you about.
I have cancer.
(Latin music playing loudly) Okay, I don't have cancer.
Terrible lie.
- Never should've said it.
- You just faked cancer? Let's leave the past in the past, okay? I didn't know any other way to get you here.
Oh, so you had to lie? Technically, we're never supposed to intervene in a human's life.
Oh, is that some sort of angel rule? As a matter of fact, it is, yes.
We're supposed to help from afar, be subtle about things.
You know, like implant an inspirational thought, or nudge you towards the conditioner that would give your hair that perfect bounce.
- The Pantene? - You're welcome.
(chuckles) But if I see you're about to go down a dangerous path, what am I gonna do, stick my head up my ass? What are you talking about, Ã¢ÂÂdangerous pathÃ¢ÂÂ? Follow me.
(giggling) Allison: Oh.
I didn't know they were having dinner tonight.
Evan said he was working.
He's working on boning your best friend.
They've hooked up once before.
Some light petting I won't go into details.
- Second base.
- What?! Boobs, dude.
(belches) And some dry humping, but please, I just, I don't want to get into the details.
Allison: I'm sorry, Evan is cheating? With Jill? Kid, I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey.
Would it cheer you up to know that there is a taquito behind your ear? (crunching taquito) These are surprisingly crunchy.
(low, indistinct conversation) Hey, guys.
- Oh.
Hey, babe.
- Hi.
Wha What are you doing here? I thought you were working late.
Allison: Oh, I just you know What are you doing here? Um (chuckles): I guess you caught us.
I can't believe this.
How could you? How could I what? And, Jill, you're hooking up with my boyfriend? Allison, wh-what are you talking about? We didn't hook up.
Oh, then what the hell is this? With the coffee and the cakes? Babe, there's just one cake.
Look I wasn't going to tell you, but I'm-I'm making a video for the party tomorrow night, of all the big moments in your life.
Because moving in together is the biggest moment in my life.
- Yeah? - And Jill was just helping me out.
She just brought over pics that I can scan.
Jill: This is us at prom.
This was when we were in Greece.
Oh, and one of us at Red Lobster.
It's a little weird you have a picture from that day.
It was a big moment.
It's really sweet.
Oh, my God, you guys.
I'm so sorry.
I just totally freaked out.
Can we please just forget I said anything? - Um, yeah.
- I'm so sorry.
Evan: Babe, why would you even think that? - I don't know.
I'm sorry.
- Ah, come here.
He's lying.
I know they were hooking up.
- How? - An angel knows.
- And I hacked into his e-mails.
- What?! - I told you I'm a wiz at the computer.
- Ugh! Oh, please, no, stop.
Please.
Let me explain.
- Are you crying? - No.
There's habanero pepper in this taquito and I'm literally digesting lava.
I want you out of my life.
Seriously.
I will get a restraining order.
My uncle's a lawyer.
Your uncle's a dentist.
Why do you know everything? I am going back inside to have dinner with my non-cheating boyfriend and my best friend.
Crazy ladies not invited.
Well, I'm not following you, but I got to go to the bathroom.
I've got a nuclear situation here and it ain't a drill.
Allison: Hi.
You look gorgeous.
So good to see you.
Hello.
Hey, you.
Hi, Brad.
How's the cleanse going? Oh, I stopped it last week.
Didn't I tell you? You did not.
Spacey actress.
(both laugh) Anyway, how is it going for you? Uh, good for me.
I'm-I'm-I'm loving it.
Yeah.
I've had some vertigo and full body sweats, but other than and I am a little weak, actually, but good.
- Cool.
- So, um Yeah, I'm loving the clean living.
- It's going to be my thing now.
- Do you want to get drunk? - Absolutely.
- Come on.
(pop music playing, muffled) Man, I got to stop intervening.
Are you talking to me? Evan's cheating on Allison, and I just want to go in there and bust him, but I can't.
I'm trying to be more disciplined.
Okay, I don't know any of the people you're talking about.
What? Boo.
Bad neighbor.
- All right.
- Get out of here.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Hey, don't let him take a whizz on my chariot.
It's my only mode of transport post DWI.
Speaking of which, do you know a good attorney? Like, an affordable guy, someone who's not going to ask a lot of questions? Have a nice night.
You, too, pal.
Hey, and introduce yourself to Allison! She's the best! Welcome, everybody, to our first party.
(cheering) I'll keep it short.
Um I just want to say how truly lucky I feel to have met this man.
- Aw - He makes me feel safe and loved and I'm so happy we're living together.
No, I'm the lucky one to have you.
Hear, hear! (laughter) - I'm pretty great.
- Yes, you are.
- We're out of beer.
- We're out of beer.
Get some more beer.
Love is in the air, huh? Oh, sorry, yeah.
I need two cases of Anchor Steam delivered to Weird.
Uh, no, not you.
No.
Two cases of Anchor Steam delivered to My clover charm? Weird.
(laughing) Hey.
Hi.
Hey, are you missing your clover charm? The one we got in Ireland? Yeah.
How'd you know? Because it was in Evan's office.
On his couch.
Evan and I hooked up.
(partygoers gasp, music stops) God, I'm so sorry.
- What? - What?! It happened when we were making the video.
Things got out of hand.
I promise it'll never happen again.
- Seriously? - Seriously?! Not your moment, Brad.
- Are you kidding me? - Are you kidding me? No-no-no.
I-I - We did not hook up.
- Oh? Okay, I did, but just give me one minute to explain.
Which part? The cheating or the-the making me feel horrible for accusing you of cheating while you were cheating? All right, this move-in has brought up a lot of issues for me.
- What issues? - Okay, uh, well, uh, first of all, uh, we're very different people.
- Oh, okay.
- 'Cause I'm super chill - Mm.
- but you, you're so intense.
Plus you're always on the phone or you're at the office.
You have literally worked about every weekend since we have been together.
Well, somebody's got to work around here.
(partygoers gasp) Oh.
So there it is.
You don't believe in my business plan.
An app where you can choose different skin colors for your photos? Uh, it's like Benetton.
Okay, it promotes tolerance.
It promotes blackface.
No, it-it doesn't.
It Okay, we're just gonna need to cool things off here before someone says something they're going to regret.
Oh, okay, well, how about this? How about leave and never come back? I'm serious.
Go.
I'm going to go.
- That's what I said.
- Yeah.
And then I said it.
(door shuts) Oh, my God.
Uh, yeah, hi.
Uh, everybody, the, um, party celebrating my relationship ended when my relationship ended.
You heard her, folks! Move it or lose it! Wow.
Okay.
Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, kiddo.
I heard he was cheating and I didn't want to believe it.
You deserve so much better than him.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Love you, kiddo.
(knocking on door) Amy: Ta-da! (chuckles) So creepy.
I was just going to leave the plate, but I thought, ""Who eats unattended camp food, huh ?"" FYI, best s'more ever.
Well, here it is on a Sunday morning and the doctor is in.
My diagnosis: nerdialence.
Look, I don't know how you knew but you knew.
Evan and Jill were hooking up.
You were right, go ahead, throw it in my face.
Aw, sorry, kid.
That must feel terrible.
It does.
Here, take a bite.
(sighs) Nobody's made me s'mores - since I was a kid - Since you were a little girl.
- Your mom used to make them for you.
- Yeah, my mom used to - She used to make them for me whenever I - She used to make them for you Okay, can I please finish a nostalgic thought.
Sure.
She used to make them for me just because.
Mm.
She called it my reward for being me.
She'd surprise me with a plate every few months.
That's why I made the s'more.
I wanted to remind you of a time when you felt really loved.
Well that is not how I feel now.
Pity party, your table's ready.
What? I barely got choked up.
Do you know what your problem is? You take care of everybody but yourself, and that attracts people who take advantage.
I mean, you basically supported your boyfriend, your let your brother sleep in your garage.
What is your point? Living for others never end well.
It drains you, honey.
Now, take a bite.
Hmm? Wow.
(laughing) That's amazing.
Look at that smile, huh? That's the smile of a happy kid, huh? Living in the moment, free from everybody's expectations.
Settle down.
(laughing) Personal space.
Oh, Allison, I could help you.
You just need somebody to nudge you, to say, get off the phone, have a weekday margarita, have some fun, let some random guy take you to O-town.
Oh, I was with you right up until the end.
Ah, you don't just deserve to be happy and to be loved.
It's your birthright.
And I want nothing less for you.
You might even say it's my mission in life.
(clicks tongue) But (snaps fingers) if all this angel stuff is too bizarre for you, I understand, I get it and I'll leave you alone.
Walk very slowly just in case she wants to change her mind.
It's not that I believe you're an angel.
- But? - But you know, I could use a weird friend.
Look at me.
Yeah, I know.
Do they come any weirder? (laughing) You got coffee in there? I do.
CrÃ¨me de menthe.
Mm, shocker.
Let's get our Sunday on, huh? (dog barking in distance) (""The Funeral"" by Band of Horses plays) (music stops) (phone buzzing) What?",fail
19,Saint George,"Albert pujols, que te pasa? No tengo mucha energia.
Ay, toma eso! Ay, la energia! Ay, la energia! La energia.
It's a home run.
Look at you, sitting here on a saturday night watching yourself on tv.
I was enjoying myself.
Can I tell you something and you won't get mad? You're fat, boring, and stupid.
Yeah, why would I get mad at that? Ay, por dios, that's why you don't have a woman in your life.
I'm not interested in dating, okay? I'm putting all my energy into my work.
Work? Work is when you get calluses and Backaches digging ditches, laying bricks, picking lettuce.
What do you do? Sit on your ass and play with juice.
For your information, la energia is now the fifth-largest energy drink.
That cat pee? All you did was combine some cactus juice with enough caffeine to shut down your organs.
Genius.
Well, whatever it is, it's working, okay? I'm expanding into three new markets, and now into the Philippines.
Beautiful.
Now they got something to drink while they make baskets with their feet.
Baskets with their feet? Mom, the philippines is one of the oldest and richest cultures in the world.
They make baskets with their feet.
What do you want me to tell you? Now they'll make 'em faster.
There you go, Harper.
Don't tell your mom you're playing without a helmet.
Yo, Georgie! Hey, junior was helping me find my blood pressure medicine, and we found these old pictures.
Yeah, and some Candy.
Hey, Georgie, I'm keeping this one.
Oh, which one? Which one? Which one? Let me see.
Oh, yeah, daddy, you gotta take that one to the bar and show all the people.
Hey, they'll all be laughing, giving us free drinks.
Harper, honey, come on.
It's time for your music lesson.
Okay, mom.
Oh, lady Mac.
You are a beautiful ray of sunscreen.
Thank you, Tio.
That is the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me in this house.
Who's this? That's a picture of the Brown M&M when he was a preteen.
Oh, look! He's so chubby and cute! His face is all scrunched up.
He looks like a little mexican bulldog.
He's got, like, a little under-bite.
He's like, wah, wah, wah, wah.
Okay, all right.
Enough with the compliments, I can't take it! Oh, my God, look! It's our wedding photo.
Oh, my God, look at us.
We are so young and naive.
Yeah, I wish I knew then what it was gonna cost me now.
I'm ready to go, mom.
Okay, honey.
Harper, remember, the chiropractor said don't carry the bassoon on your back.
I still look the same.
How long has it been, Georgie? Like, what, a year? 13 months, junior.
13 months? Without any personal, like, intercourse? Georgie, you need to get out there more, man.
You're not getting no younger! Whoa, whoa, look at his hair, daddy.
It's getting all gray.
You should see my friend Larry.
Jet-black hair.
He's out there every night-- Sassa-Sass-- Knocking it out.
Larry told me, ""Tell your fat cousin, when he's ready to start dating, I can hook him up.
"" That's nice.
Right? Yeah.
All right.
Hey, thursday.
You make it Harder when you don't study.
Oh, you wanted to see me? Undressed.
What? Ay, jorjito, I love this little touch of gray.
Does the carpet match the drapes? I don't have carpet.
I'm more hardwood floor.
Right now, I'm the opposite of hard wood.
Hmm.
I need to speak to you in my office.
Okay.
Come in.
Shut the door.
Oh.
I'd rather not.
Have a seat.
Uh, you know, I'd prefer to stand.
You know, um, every time you see me, you hit on me.
Then let me hit it, and I'll quit hitting on you.
Um You know, I'm at this school to teach.
Okay.
Hmm.
Right.
In case you're wondering, I'm wearing a thong.
Yeah, I was kinda guessing big-girl panties.
I know you, George.
I know you've undressed me with your eyes.
I've done a lot of things with my eyes, and right now, I'm thinking about sewing 'em shut.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
I can tell, it's too soon after your divorce.
I see.
You're not ready.
You're not ready to enjoy.
No.
To indulge.
It's okay, I'll wait.
You better not, you know? I'm on a lot of heart medicine.
And I could go like that.
You're so bad! Ay! Yo, Georgie.
Hey.
We're gonna put you back in the dating world.
Here.
Toma.
What are you doing with my phone? I'm bringing you to the 21st dimension.
You ever heard of sexting? Whoa, hey.
I'm not ready to date with my penis or yours.
No, all the kids are doing it.
Everybody's throwing pictures of their shillelaghs out there.
Oh, junior, come on.
It's touching the screen, man! Shut up! Let him do his work! There you go.
Oh Feast your eyes on this.
Let me see that, mijo.
Damn! That's my boy! Hey.
And that's without notice.
Is that supposed to be me? You wish it was you.
I'm gonna text it to a few people.
The worm is on the hook.
Let's see what you can catch.
I'm gonna text it to this dude at the market too.
Well, why? He's a good dude.
Eh? Okay, delete that, now! Easy.
Just one push of the button.
Boom, it's erased.
See? Yeah, but it's not erased from my mind.
Like a flaccid tootsie roll.
Yo, fool, tonight we're going to el sueno.
I have to teach tonight.
""I have to teach tonight.
"" After class, ese, it's on, because el Sueno is jumping.
All kinds of chicks, right, daddy? Hey, most of them, we're old enough to be their dads.
All right, that's disgusting.
I know, George! That's why we should go! Hey! Give them something to regret! Look, I haven't dated out of respect for Mackenzie.
You do realize that the only two women in your life is your mom and ex-wife? Georgie, what kind of mexican are you? You should have all kinds of kids showing up out of nowhere! With luggage! What do I want all kinds of kids for? To help you move, to help you do the yard work, to answer the door, to get you a cigarette.
Yeah, that's what I do for daddy.
Here you go.
If I dated, it would be embarrassing for Mackenzie.
I mean, you saw the way she looked at the wedding picture.
Man, she's still all in love.
Ay, Georgie.
Dile, dile.
Dile! Tell him now.
I don't think so, bro.
I've seen her out with some dudes.
What, you mean in a group, right? No, man.
One on one.
With hors D'oeuvres.
And if the dude's paying For hors d'oeuvres, he's trying to get to the bottom of it.
The fine print, Georgie.
Come on, junior, you don't think you should've told me this before? I am telling you now.
Look, she's out there, living it up, getting it on, talking low, sitting outside.
And if they're already sitting outside, they're getting it on.
Daddy always says, if I can get 'em outside, I can get it on.
That's right! Showing her toes.
Showing her toes? Ah, this guy.
You don't know nothing, do you, Georgie? If they're showing their toes--If they're showing their toes, it means they're letting it out! Letting everybody know they got no corns, bunions, inhibitions, all ten nails! Sometimes, on the little toe, if the nail falls off-- they just paint the skin.
Okay, have you two guys been painting cars with the garage door closed again? Georgie, you're a very rigid individual.
You have to stop thinking about everything.
You have to get out there and have some fun! Look, Mac is out there, having fun.
Showing toes.
You're right.
I mean, Mackenzie's dating and I'm here at home, being insulted by my mom.
That's what I'm talking about! We're gonna get out there, and we're gonna attack it! George! Like a bull in a doughnut shop! Yo! Dad, have you seen my inhaler? Uh, yeah.
Here it is.
Hey, why don't you go breathe over there? Are you dying your hair? I'm trying a new shampoo.
Shouldn't you be in the shower then? Shouldn't you be on the other side of that door then? Harper, honey, did you find your inhaler? Yeah.
Are you dying your hair? That's funny to you, huh? Hey, Harper, honey, go downstairs.
I'll be down in a minute.
You know, I'm just a little prematurely gray.
At your age, it's not premature.
Do you even know what you're doing? Did you read the directions? I never read the instructions.
What's so hard? You put it on, and when it stops burning, you rinse it out.
Oh, my God.
Let me help.
So, you're trying to look younger.
You got a hot date or something? No, I don't have a hot date.
Why? Do you have a hot date? What's that supposed to mean? Junior told me, Mac, that you started dating.
Hold on.
You're not jealous, are you? Of what? Of you dating? Come on, I'm a man.
Men don't get jealous.
Oh.
So has anybody-- that's disgusting.
And also it's really none of your business.
So what do you do with Harper? You leave him with me while you're out there showing your toes? Showing my toes? You really don't know anything, do you? You know what? Forget this.
You can do it yourself.
Well, fine.
Well, I'm glad you're dating again.
Oh? I'm thrilled.
In fact, I think it's healthy.
Tonight, me, junior, and Tio, we're all going to el sueno.
Good for you.
Yeah.
And I'll probably go out the next night, the night after that, the night after that.
Then I'll probably take a night off, then I'll probably go out, like, four nights in a row.
George, do not turn this into a competition.
I'm not competing.
But as soon as my scalp stops burning, it's on.
All right.
I hope you're ready.
You have 20 minutes-- there you go-- to complete this test.
Is that your Porsche Cayenne in the parking lot? Yeah.
You know what it is? So what did you do? I mean, this teaching thing's gotta be some court-ordered community service.
Oh, really? You don't think I'm here because maybe I possibly want to be here? No.
Come on, what was it? Is it cocaine? Weed? How'd you get that fine new car, ese? I beat a white kid to death.
Good luck tonight, Mr.
L.
What are you talking about? I can smell your cologne from the back of the room.
Expensive suit, shoes all shined, new hair-- You look hot.
That's inappropriate, young lady.
Ay, papi! There is something about you tonight.
I think it's in the air.
Or it could be me.
I'm very hormonal right now.
Georgie, hey! Let's go.
El sueno time! Oh, I've never been to el sueno.
I've always wanted to go.
It's a wonderful dining experience.
Ay, dios mio! I'm George's uncle.
I'm George's boss, Concepcion.
I never realized such beauty walked the halls of this particular institution.
Yeah, well, you went to the pet shop once and tried to buy Mickey Mouse.
Please, tell me if I'm being too gallant.
You're being too gallant.
Not you, stupid.
Her! Come on.
Excuse us.
Come on, man, let's go.
What is wrong with you? Man, look at homegirl's wearing the hell out of that dress.
She sure is.
That's a lot to ask spandex to do.
Ay, I'm so bad! Come on, let's go.
Tio, you were right, There are some fine women here tonight.
And they're all waiting for you, Georgie, because you look so ""Capitating.
"" George.
Vodka rocks with a lemon twist.
Tio and junior, amaretto sour.
Thanks, Chloe.
Okay, look around the room, Georgie.
Set the bar.
All right, set the bar.
Oh, how about that one right there? Uh, set the bar lower, Georgie.
Oh That one.
Lower.
There's your girl right there.
Her? Yeah.
All you have to do is walk up to her and say, ""Hello.
"" Buy her a drink.
Hey, hey, and if she don't want a drink, buy her something deep-fried, like potato skins.
She'll be all flattered.
You guys really think I'm that sad? Yeah.
Go on.
Come on, Georgie.
Go on, go on.
Georgie, she's waiting for you.
She's waiting.
Shh! Good luck.
What happened? You got shot down already? I didn't even get to the potato skin part.
Okay, let's all try one together.
All right? How about those three girls over there? No, man, they're so young.
Exactly! We're going in.
Relax.
And don't talk.
Let daddy do all the talking.
Now, look, Georgie.
Look mysterious and remotely confused, like this.
Watch out.
All right.
And walk like a man! Come on.
Not interested.
Not interested in spending the evening with three fascinating individuals? You guys are, like, old enough to be our dads.
If they bother you too much, use this.
Pepper spray.
That pepper spray, that won't stop me.
I love hot Food.
For my daddy, that's more of a condiment than a deterrent.
What are you talking about? This stuff burns.
Pepper spray doesn't work on you? My daddy doesn't succumb to pain.
How can it affect everyone else but you? Fortunately, I was born without tear ducts.
Spray me right between the eyes.
Oh, okay, listen, Tio.
Don't get too crazy, okay? Nobody's gonna get sprayed.
Spray him! Do it! No, no.
Look at this, ladies.
Oh Have you ever seen a mexican bulldog? Okay.
Put that thing away.
Look at the boobies! They're fantastic.
Wow.
Aren't they divine? That's enough.
They never even jiggled when he ran.
That's enough.
That's why this fool hasn't had a woman in-- Aah! My eyes! Oh, my eyes! Ay, god damn, my eyes! Oh, you son of a bitch! Daddy, don't leave me! Oh, hi.
Are you alone? No, I'm by myself.
That's different.
There's no shame in sitting alone.
Did you come down here to check up on me? What? Are you jealous? Jealous? I'm the one already dating.
I thought this wasn't a competition.
But if it was, you'd be losing.
Nice.
What's this? Aww, your cute little picture.
God, great boobs, by the way.
Tio and junior trying to get free drinks? Tio got pepper sprayed.
He's in the men's room crying.
Pepper sprayed? Again? So did you hit on any women yet? Excuse me, I'm a gentleman, okay? I don't hit on women.
Oh.
Those three right there, I bought them potato skins.
It's been 15 years since I've been out looking for women, and I wasn't good at it 15 years ago.
That's True.
We never would've met if I hadn't talked to you first.
I saw you coming over to me, and I was like, ""Oh, my god, please, don't come over here and talk to me.
I'm gonna pretend I don't speak english.
"" Really? Why did you think that? Well, to be honest, look at you.
You were way out of my league.
I still am.
George, listen.
If you're gonna be dating, just promise me one thing.
When you approach a woman- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're gonna tell me how to approach a woman? Yes.
Listen, the reason you're so awkward around women is that you still feel like this: A shy, 10-year-old mexican boy.
You know, women, they pick up on this stuff, George.
Yeah, can women pick up when a man doesn't want to have a conversation anymore? You're not Alma's little boy anymore.
Come on, you're a successful businessman who created the sixth-most popular energy drink.
Fifth.
See? So show women that side, huh? The confident you.
You know, and then if you're not too scared, you can show 'em some of that tenderness you like to hide from everybody.
That's what I fell in love with.
Who knows, maybe you'll fool 'em long enough to-- Hee-Hoo, Hee-Hoo.
Sa-Sass! Twice? Forget it.
Why don't you come have a drink with me and my friends? No, you go have fun with your friends.
I'm okay.
All right.
Hey, Chloe.
I want to buy that lady right there a drink.
All right, old man.
Oh, hey.
He's on the bathroom floor with his eyes swollen shut.
You can't miss him.
He's the one without tear ducts.
Hi.
Are you alone? I am alone.
Would you care to join me? Thank you for the drink.
You're welcome.
That's a-- That's a beautiful dress.
Thank you.
It's new.
My hair's new.
It was a lot grayer this morning.
I think it looks great.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Beat it, bitch.
I'm right here, and I've been drinking.
Why don't you go over there before you get hurt, huh? What the hell are you doing? Oh, you so bad, papi! I got your picture! You sexted me, tigre! What? I didn't sext you.
Liar.
I was charging my phone, and look what popped up.
Bam! Whoo! Okay, that's not me.
Well, there's only one way to prove it.
Like Cinderella, see if it fits.
And if it doesn't fit better.
Ay Mijo! Mijo, don't lose me, mijo.
You're the wind beneath my arms.
Georgie, they're taking my daddy to the cedars.
You know what? I better go with them.
You know, they're family.
They don't have I.
D.
One of them is undocumented.
I'm gonna take my drink, though.
Hello, ladies.
Is everything to your satisfaction? Ay, you so bad.
Ooh, it grows.
Oy.
Whoo.
What are you watching? You came home alone? Figures.
You gotta tell them you got money.
That's how old guys like you get girls.
Listen, I am a successful latino businessman, okay? There are lots of girls that would love to be in a relationship with me.
Can I tell you something and you won't get mad? Probably not.
The longest relationship you've ever had is with your hand.
Wha-- The other hand.
Not that it's any of your business, but I do think I'm gonna start dating again.
Perfecto.
That's what the dating world needs, another fat-ass out there.
You know what? I'll be all right.
You can look everywhere, but you'll never find another woman.
Better than your mother.
Oh, my god, you almost had me.
You-- Don't touch me with that hand! Cochino! Are these yours? Mira!",fail
20,Crowded,"From the moment your kids are born, you dread the fact that one day they'll leave you.
And then they do.
And it's just as bad as you thought it'd be.
I just want you to remember that you're special.
And you'll always be my little girl.
Two forms of birth control.
And men, are like basketball players, - they dribble before they shoot.
- Martina! It's reality, Mike.
That's how we ended up with this one.
Bye, guys.
I'll miss you.
Oh, I'll miss you too.
- Bye, Dad.
- Love you, kid.
Love you.
Well, at least now we know what it's like.
The next one will be easier.
What are you looking at? It's just us now, we're alone! Wow.
The empty nest.
We're gonna die in this house.
I need alcohol.
It is only 10 A.
M.
Well, on the other hand, we don't have to drive anybody anywhere.
Or cook anyone dinner, or set a good freakin' example.
Hey, we don't have to say ""freakin'"" anymore! We can swear when we want.
Drink when we want.
Have sex when we want.
Have sex when we want.
There's a reason I said that twice.
This could be good.
This could be really good.
Finally getting rid of the playroom.
Turn it into a media room.
Big-ass plasma, we'll have an old-timey pop-corn machine, one of those big chairs with the cup-holders.
I'll be just like a Hollywood douchebag.
Hey.
- I got a new Would You Rather.
- Oh yeah? OK.
Would you rather have sex with Kate Upton ten minutes after she's dead, or, have sex with a live 90-year-old.
I've never loved you more than I do at this moment.
So sick, yet, so perfectly balanced.
Thank you.
Kate Upton.
This is the perfect way to celebrate writing our last tuition check, and your dad and stepmother finally moving to Florida.
The last piece to the freedom puzzle.
Look what I found! That's pot! Our kids were doing drugs? Mike? - Martina? - It's your parents! Hide the pot! Wow.
I just felt so young.
- Bob? - What? - They're in the playroom! - What? The playroom! They're fine.
Alice, again, the key that we made for you and Dad was for emergencies.
We knocked on the door, and you didn't answer.
It could have been an emergency.
Why didn't you just ring the bell? Ring the bell? Oh, child, please, we're family.
Family doesn't ring the bell.
Oh, hey, Pop.
Oh, good, you're finally cleaning this room.
You didn't have all these toys when you were a kid.
I know.
You spoiled those girls.
You know, when Mike was young, I taught him how to do military sheet corners.
He couldn't go out to play until I could bounce a coin off his tightly made bed.
I still get a little tense when I see a quarter.
We tried to help with Stella and Shea.
Yes, you were here all the time.
Well, we're headed to the store.
We'll bring you back some donuts.
Alice, we don't eat donuts.
And you know I'm gluten-free.
Oh, that nonsense.
That's why you're so skinny.
I don't think I'm too skinny.
You can't see your own skinny.
It's like smelling your own breath.
You need someone else to tell you that it's bad.
Mike, I'll pick you up some breath mints.
When are you gonna stand up to them? Well, I've always said ""soon"".
But now that they're moving, I can give the truthful answer: never.
So what are we gonna do with this? What if ""Horton Hears a Who!"" is real? Deep.
You know what's great about smoking pot when you're older? You don't get paranoid.
It's the cops! Oh, thank God, you're home! - Stella? - Brace yourselves.
I left Justin.
I thought he was my soulmate, and now, we don't even hate the same Kardashians.
We had this big fight, and he's dead to me.
Is he dead to everyone, did you kill him? Answer your father! What is wrong with you guys? Nothing.
I could really use a pizza, but go on.
Ok.
Well, I'm here because I'm not getting any acting jobs, and my YouTube videos don't get enough hits.
And some of those comments, are so mean.
This one guy wrote, ""you're a waste of human skin, you hot-skank mess.
"" I mean the ""hot"" was sweet.
But the rest being an adult is hard.
Plus I miss you guys, so - I was wondering - Hello, all.
Forgive the surprise.
Shea? What are you doing here? - I'm moving back home.
- What? But I told you I was coming here today to move back home.
What? Yes, but I reasoned that the cumulative impact on them would be reduced if it were simultaneous rather than staggered.
Ew.
Shea, you don't just break into someone's scene.
We're not in a movie, Stella.
This is the real world.
A world where thanks to this country's hatred of science, the funding for my job has been eliminated.
So, like 23.
8% of people between the ages of 22 and 31, I've determined the most logical course of action in this economy, is to move back in with my parents.
And because of the broad number of young people doing this, there's no longer the social stigma attached.
Though, it pains me to admit I care about such things.
Is she done? I can never tell when she's done.
I'm the one who should move back in.
Mom and Dad are like my best friends.
They're my only friends! Girls, girls, don't fight.
You're equally disappointing both of us.
- Hello? We hear voices in there.
- Oh, boy.
It's Grandma! Are you girls here for our anniversary dinner? - Oh, no.
I'm moving back home today.
- So am I.
Oh, well, we certainly can't move to Florida now! It looks like you need us again.
Who wants donuts? They're back! They're all back! It's a nightmare.
It's a [Bleep.]
disaster! Oh, god, we can't say [Bleep.]
anymore.
- Where are you going? - Where there's donuts.
Hey.
You got a passenger.
Real slacker type.
Sounds like my daughter's boyfriend.
It is my daughter's boyfriend.
Oh, that knock.
Come in, Justin.
Hey.
Hey.
Here's how you knock.
It's not Why? Because we as a society have decided that's how you knock.
What are you doing here? I miss Stella.
I was hoping you'd help me get her back.
Look, Justin, no man thinks any guy is good enough for his little girl.
And then I met you, and please don't take this the wrong way, but I thought, he's not even close.
I mean, do you even have a job? I have something better than a job.
An idea for an app.
Everybody with the apps.
Man, it's awesome.
But figuring out how to actually make it, super hard.
Look, that's the problem with people your age, once it gets hard, you quit.
You gotta stick with things.
I like that.
Could you text that to me? Get out.
What happens if I push this button? That'll get you out even faster.
Push it.
A mess.
We spent so much time teaching the girls how special they are, why didn't we teach them how to shut a cabinet door? Why do we buy free-range chicken? I mean, how free are they really? It's not like they're letting them walk into town.
Speaking of - freeing things - Mike, stop it.
We are not asking the girls to leave.
They're hurting right now, and they need us.
Ok.
It's quiet.
Maybe we can have the place to ourselves.
- No one yelling out.
- Mom? Mom? Tell Shea she's never gonna get a date with Carter if she texts like a dorky virgin.
Let me see what you wrote, honey.
""I'm interested in dating you.
Do you share similar feelings?"" - Ooh.
That's bad.
- I know.
But Stella wants me to text ""Hang sometime?"" I can't send that.
It's a meaningless statement.
Shea, you have to put yourself out there, be sexy, and stop dressing like Doria.
I've put myself out there with Carter.
Last week, he was making an AU calculation that would have been off by thousands of parsecs and I thoughtfully pointed out his mistake.
That's love.
Is she done? I can never tell when she's done.
- Mom, talk to her.
- Honey, you never correct a man you like.
Really? Until you're married and have two daughters to back you up.
Look, men are like balloons.
They don't want anyone to pop 'em and show that it's all just air inside.
All you gotta do is fill that balloon with what they want to hear.
It's like how for Dad you act all excited about the Mets.
Hey, I never pushed Shea to be a Mets fan.
You named me after their stadium.
But I love the Mets because you love them.
That's my girl.
Ok, it works.
""Hang sometime?"" And send.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
If you know all this, how come you can't work things out with Justin? It's just super hard when two brilliant complex artists get together.
We're still talking about you and Justin, right? I miss him so much.
Look, Stella, why don't you forget about boys, and focus on what you're gonna do with your life? Maybe you're right.
I mean, I have a degree in Theater Arts.
It's crazy that I'm not using it.
Oh, you're using it some.
I'm a singer and an actress.
- That's like having two lottery tickets.
- Yes.
As valuable as two lottery tickets.
Hey, let's all do something.
We could watch a movie like when we were kids.
Perhaps a Disney princess movie? Not Beauty and the Beast.
Belle is so basic.
Don't you put down Belle.
She was willing to marry an animal to get a good library.
I'm exhausted.
I forgot how much energy parenting takes.
But they like us.
They really do.
How do we get away from them? A naked woman in bed with me, the only reason I ever do anything.
Lying, sneaking off to a hotel.
We're like Stella in high school.
No kid talk.
That's the deal.
Whatever it is, they can wait 5 minutes.
I mean 45 minutes.
But it could be the girls.
It's Shea.
Carter hasn't texted back.
Now it's Stella.
Justin got tagged in a picture with some girl.
Oh, my poor babies.
Ok.
No, no, look, you're gonna do that thing now, where you're thinking about the kids when we're about to have sex.
I'm gonna be here doing some of my best work and you're gonna have this worried look in your eyes.
I can't help it.
A mother is only as happy as her unhappiest child.
What about her unhappiest husband? You know what, hon? We should probably just go.
Why? Wait, that is not fair.
I wanna do this.
Don't you get it? The fun is over.
I mean this is supposed to be our time.
But it is their time again.
Oh my god.
You're right.
This is our life now.
Isn't it? There is no getting away from them.
You know whose fault it is? It's ours.
We did this.
We made them our friends.
We were so involved in their lives, we listened, we - supported, we validated.
- We blew it.
Now we have to sneak off to a hotel room to get away from them? If we'd only spanked them once, we could have saved $200.
We could have saved a boatload more if we'd done what my father did, and just left.
It's too late for that.
Okay, I'm in.
They got to go.
- And your parents.
- All right, here's the deal.
Tomorrow is their anniversary party.
We get everybody together, we tell them how much we love 'em, - and then we kick 'em to the curb.
- Deal.
All right.
Let's get our 200 bucks worth.
Oh, this one's from Mike and Martina.
I bet it's that scarf I've been hinting at.
Oh look, Bob, it's some sort of coupon.
It's airline miles.
Yes, we gifted you our miles, so that when you do decide to move to Florida you can upgrade to 1st class if there's a seat available.
""If there's a seat""? So, we go to the airport, with no idea where we're going to sit, and then just announce ourselves like we think we're so great? I don't think 1st class is for us.
We'd be uncomfortable.
But there's more room and you get to board first.
But then we'd have to watch the other passengers go by us.
Everybody hates those 1st class people when they walk by them.
We'd be the people they hate! Look, let's just call this a bad gift and move on.
Our gift aside, I would like to make a toast.
Multi-generational events like this remind one of the natural order of things.
First you're a child, then you grow older, and eventually you leave home and stand proudly upon your own two feet taking any jobs you can, even if it's not your dream.
THen you grow old and you move to Florida.
Cheers.
But you and Mom always told us to follow our dreams.
Yes, we did and that may have been a mistake.
See, we didn't think everybody in your generation would have the same dream, to be an actress or win singing competitions.
Surely you're not equating my dream of becoming an astronaut with hoping that a chair turns around on The Voice.
Dad, what are you trying to tell us? Clearly they want us to leave.
- Is that true? - Well, - it might be time.
- Wow.
- I didn't know you guys didn't want us here.
- Neither did I.
Sometimes I have trouble with social cues.
I was perceiving joy and you were feeling shackled, and burdened.
- No, no.
- We do not feel that way, and we want to be supportive in any way we can.
Well, that didn't take long.
What is that supposed to mean? You're going soft already.
You remember the summer that you turned 16? I locked you out of the house with a bowl of cereal and the Want Ads and I said, ""don't you come home until you've got a job"".
Now that's parenting.
I hated you that day.
I thought to myself, ""I can't wait to get away from these people.
"" See? Success! I would never do that to my daughters! - I like them.
- Well, there's your mistake.
You love your children, you don't like them! I wanna be close to my girls.
When I was growing up, you and Mom had no idea what was going on in my life.
We weren't that interested in you.
Well, I'm not you, Dad.
And I don't push my kids away when they need me.
Girls, you can stay.
You might call that weak, I call it a strong man making a strong decision.
It's okay with you, dear? Of course.
We love you.
That's good parenting, right here.
Oh, that knock! It's Justin.
Hi, Stella, you look smokin'.
Hey, everybody.
Justin, why are you here? I'm taking your dad's advice.
- He told me I shouldn't quit on you.
- I did not say that.
Well, something like that.
You never texted me, so I don't got it exactly.
But he said, if you want something, you should stick with it.
And I want you.
Justin I want you too.
You're a full balloon and no one should pop you.
I'll explain metaphor to her later.
Let's go home baby.
Um, about that we kinda got evicted.
Well, you can stay here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you guys are not even married.
I hear ya, bro.
Stella, will you marry me? - No, no, no! - Yes! I should rub it in, but I just feel sorry for you.
How can you drink iced lattes at this time of night? Why does that bother you? I sleep fine.
It's just suspicious.
- Is she really gonna marry that guy? - Oh let's don't think about that tonight.
Honey, we can keep the fun going.
How about you go get some wine and I'll put on something ridiculous.
Are we talking parading? Oh, I'll parade.
I love a parade.
Alice sent me to make sure we're not stuck with those miles.
- We'll get you another gift.
- Oh, good.
Nothing crazy this time.
- Now, about our staying - Dad, go to Florida.
Have fun.
We really don't need your help here.
Well, don't tell your stepmom that.
She was miserable about moving.
You know, it's nice to feel needed, and not just going some place warm to rot and die.
Besides, who wants to be around a lot of old people.
Old people are annoying.
Are they? I know you think I'm too conservative and old-fashioned, but I did marry a black woman, that's gotta mean something.
Dad, I don't see race.
I see a bossy woman who you married, who's always in my house.
Fair enough.
You know, I don't agree with how you raised these girls, but I see how much they like you.
That must feel kinda good.
It does.
I don't think my pop even knew I existed until I was standing in his direct line of sight.
Well, he never talked to you? Asked you how you're feeling? How you doing? Never.
- Different times.
- Yeah, different times, but it would have been nice if he had, right? Yeah.
It would have been nice.
Goodnight, Son.
Goodnight, Dad.
- Mike? - Yeah? How you doin', Son? I'm good.
You? Good too.
Good.
Did you tell him we don't want the miles? What? - The miles! - He told me.
I hope whatever you put on is easy to take off.
Hello, ladies.
Good news, honey, the girls came in to tell me that - Carter texted back.
- Told you he would.
Remember, two forms of birth control, right, Mom and Dad? I feel very uncomfortable in this conversation.
Why? We're all adults here.
Then why are you living at home? Oh, Dad, you're so funny.
I have a suggestion: how about I get two more glasses? Ooh, I have an even better idea.
Ok, don't freak out, but I have some pot stashed in the playroom.
- I'll go get it.
- Don't bother.

21,That '80s Show,"1 Whoa! Hey, Sophia! Oh, wow, this is kind of awkward.
You're dancing with him, me dancing with her.
No, it isn't.
We broke up.
Oh.
Well, I wasn't really sure.
I mean, you know, when you said you wanted to see other people, I didn't know that meant not me.
I should have been more specific.
We're really not right for each other.
Sorry.
So, you must be the new guy, huh? What are you? A stockbroker? Drive a new Beamer? I'm a struggling musician who wrote 2 ballads about her last week.
Corey, he's not the new guy.
I just met him in the bathroom.
Look, what we had was nice, but it's over.
It's time to move on.
Fine.
Hey, great.
I am moving on! Good.
So we're crystal clear on this? We've broken up.
Hey, I'm not gonna say it again, Sophia.
It is over.
Great! Take care! I want my tapes back! Would you quit it? I hate dancing.
Hey, is my nose bleeding? Nah.
You're good.
Ok.
I've got bad news.
Sophia and I are finished.
Aw.
Yeah, I've got some bad news myself.
Kids, your mother and I split up.
That happened 2 years ago.
I know.
I just love saying it.
What is that smell? Now, that's the smell of my little entrepreneur.
That's right.
I'm making candles.
They smell like death.
Death? Or piÃÂÃ'a colada? Death.
Corey, Sophia wasn't right for you, what with her being a lesbian and all.
Katie, she's not a lesbian.
She's bisexual.
She's like a vegetarian who likes turkey every now and then.
That won't hold up in court, son.
Look, son, I know you feel lost.
You've got this worthless degree in philosophy.
That's your theory.
Your sister's a big wheel in the candle game.
Now you've gone and turned a perfectly good woman into a lady golfer.
But you need to get over it, get back in the game.
Let me fix you up with someone.
No.
Oh! My sophomore roommate from college! She's fun, tall, good-looking, straight.
How good-looking? Daddy, no.
You kids are so judgmental.
Oh, rt.
Hey, Roger.
Hey, glad you're here.

Now, either get along, or I'll fire you both.
Did you hear that? She's gonna fire you.
Not me.
I have seniority.
You.
Not me.
I don't wear a bra.

It's all sinking in, and she wants me back, right? Not exactly.
Oh, they're in the Fountain.

I saw ass! She brought back your cassettes, but she kept the party mix tapes.
And that's hilarious because because she kissed me.
This is so hot.
Oh, my God.
Where did this happen? Were you guys in the shower? She kissed you? It was just a kiss.
Nothing happened besides the kiss.
Did you struggle at first knowing it was forbidden? Then tongues, right? Roger? If she's got the hots for you and all you do is make candles, I must really be a loser.
You're not a loser.
You're more of a non-Winner.
Yeah.
Well, rt offered me a job today.
And you took it, right? I just don't know if I'd be very good at it.
It's marketing.
You write slogans, which is like writing lyrics, except it's easier 'cause they don't have to rhyme.
Oh.
""Where's the beef?"" Well, I-- you know what? I am tired of being broke.
Hell, I'm doing it.
Yes! Welcome to Reagan's America.

And now they work for me.
My name is Charlie.
Angels, you're looking for a 16-year-old runaway.
Her name is Sarah Daniels.
She's being held captive in a room somewhere in the Falcon hotel.
A notorious child trafficker known as ""Pajaro"" is attempting to sell her.
You have to find Sarah before it's too late.
Finger on the trigger, let it bang bang Oh! (Gasps) Sorry! I managed to kill your Martini and mortally wound your shirt.
God.
It's not, uh, it's not fatal.
Can I buy you a drink? Yeah, I am I am such a klutz, I'd probably spill it.

I spoke to Sarah's parents, angels.
They are incredibly relieved to have her back safe and sound.
Well, now that Mackal's been hiding behind an army of lawyers, what are the chances he'll flip on his boss Pajaro? It's doubtful Mackal's even met him.
You do realize the irony of that coming from you, right, Charlie? Oh, Miami PD's been trying to nail Pajaro for years.
He doesn't leave any footprints, electronic or otherwise.
He's a ghost.
Ghosts aren't real.
This guy is and he needs to pay.

Actually, his shift does not end until 5:00 a.
m.
Hmm.
What? He's single, he's straight, and he has a life plan.
Mixing mojitos.
No.
He is saving his money to buy a boat and sail around the world.
That is a plan.
You do realize that is not a life plan.
Okay, fine.
He's a dreamer, and that's sexy.
Please, please, come with me.
Actually, guys, I think I'm going to skip the velvet rope tonight.

I found these in your trash.
When you said your dad was reaching out, you didn't say it was a full-blown letter writing campaign.
The great white shark of wall street can be relentless, even in captivity.

It is tomorrow.

It's your dad.
I used to steal Warhols to get that man's Gloria! Please tell me she's not really gone And that I'm just gonna wake up and see her again.
You know, I-I never thought my heart could Hurt this much.
She doesn't even have any family that we can call.
We were her family.
She was our sister.
How's Charlie? Devastated.
Losing an angel is his worst nightmare.
It's mine, too.
We're gonna find out who did this.
If it's the last thing we do.
Nothing here.
We're good.
They just walked in.
Hold on a second.
We're clean on this side.
Can we have the room? Phil, let's get out of here.
Clear the room.
Okay, Charlie.
Bosley updated me.
Thank God you're okay.
Who were those people? It's just a precaution.
They're sweeping the agency.
I sent teams to your homes as well.
You think we're being targeted? I can't confirm that you're not.
Gloria was family, and her murder is our most personal case.
I need to know you're up for the fight.
Bring it on.
Just remember, you're angels of justice, not angels of vengeance.
Check this out.
I gave the cops access to all of our security cameras, except these.
Sending it to you now.
This is half an hour before you guys left the building.
Check out the woman on the motorcycle scoping Gloria's car.
She split right after the explosion, didn't call 911 or stick around and wait for the police and talk to them.
She just took off.
What's that's shadow on the back of her neck? Look at the ink.
Same as Gloria's.
Means they were members of the same car boosting crew.
I don't get it.
Gloria waved good-bye to that life when she enlisted with Uncle Sam.

Did four years at Tallahassee women's correctional.
How long she been back in Miami? Paroled six months ago.
Lives on a houseboat, Biscayne marina.
Why would she want Gloria dead? Let's go ask her.
Whoa, whoa.
Remember what Charlie said.
What? These are just conversation starters.
Guys.
Just Be careful.
For me.
Okay, calm down.
We just wanna talk.
Try knocking next time.
Why did you kill Gloria? I didn't.
Then why were you in stalker mode outside the agency last night? We caught you on tape fleeing the scene.
That doesn't make me guilty.
Innocent people don't usually run away.
I'm not playing this game.
Gloria was like a sister to me.
We need to move.
Now! All right, we got 'em! We got 'em.
Oh! Ah! Who were those shooters? In case you missed it, they tried to kill me, too.
Look easy, Abbs.
Let's do this back at the office.
No, she starts filling in the blanks right now.
I got a text from Gloria.
She wanted me to meet her after work.
Then why not come in instead of lurking around on the street? I'm shy.
Hey, did she say what she wanted? Personal case she was working on.
She wanted to show me something.
Deal with them or come with us.
It's your call.
You girls decent? Yeah, I just updated Charlie.
I've got Gloria's phone records.
She texted Eve at 12:35 a.
m.
Wow.
She wasn't lying about your mad hacking skills.
Okay, uh, I'm not a big fan of the ""h"" word.
It's like telling Picasso he's good at throwing paint onto a canvas.
Wait.
Gloria talked to you about us? Said you were the best crew she ever had.
She never mentioned you once.
That doesn't mean we weren't close.
I met Gloria when I was 5.
St.
Theresa's orphanage in El Salvador.
How did you end up in central America? My parents were aid workers.
They were killed in the civil war down there.
When I got to St.
T's, Gloria took me under her wing and protected me.
Wow.
From orphan to car thief to jailbird.
You should have your own reality show.
I'm not bitter about the cards I've been dealt.
If you wanna survive, you have to adapt.
Is that what you're doing right now? I know you're upset because Gloria came to me instead of you.
But the fact that your feelings are hurt isn't my problem.
Ding ding! Love a catfight, but, ladies, please, back to your corners.
Mm.
Eve, according to her phone records, you two have been talking a lot recently.
Yeah.
When I got paroled, Gloria was helping me get back on my feet.
I swept her hard drive, if she was working a case on her downtime, she left no trace.
Do you have any idea what she wanted to show you? No, but I think we should go check out her apartment.
Let's do it.
Since when can the cops spare extra uniforms to babysit a victim's apartment? Let's find a way in.
Yeah.
That's Gloria's balcony, third floor.
Ladies, I got this.
Hand me the Prada.
Abby put the ""cat"" in ""cat burglar.
"" Now the doughnut patrol makes sense.
Somebody made it a crime scene.
But why trash her place? They even gutted her gator.
I gave this to her last Christmas.
This is pointless.
I wouldn't say that.
You grow up in an orphanage, you learn how to hide things that are valuable.
Hey, guys.
Since when did Gloria have a cat? She didn't.
Yeah, she's allergic.
Then what's she doing with a kitty litter box? That's my girl.
Nuns force you to be crafty.
It's a class ""a"" floor safe.
Blast-resistant, biometric lock.
Last time I cracked one of these, it was under two minutes but that was after two cosmos, and I was hanging upside-down.
I know this box.
This was her mom's.
At St.
T's orphanage, she never let it go.
It's a DNA analysis report.
Came back yesterday.
Gloria had two samples tested.
A flake of blood from the box and Saliva from this shot glass.
Let's see.
Club Cypher.
That's on 10th and Collins.
The two samples match.
I wonder who the big winner is.
This is nestor rodrigo.
Why would Gloria be tracking him? Oh, my God.
She found him.
Found who? Pajaro.
How do you know about him? It's a long story.
But I had no idea she tracked him down.
Time-out.
Rodrigo's a multimillionaire.
He throws more white parties than diddy.
You sure he's Pajaro? I swear on my life.
We need to call Bos.
Yeah, we need to loop in Charlie.
Hey! Come on! Drop the gun! Give me your keys.
Eve.
Eve, what are you doing? Keeping a promise I made to Gloria a long time ago.
I'm serious.
What promise did you make? To kill Pajaro.
Eve, put the gun down.
Let's just talk this through.
There's nothing to talk about.
That's why Gloria called me the other night.
So what's your big plan? Roll up to club Cypher and blow Rodrigo away? He has to pay.
We loved Gloria, too.
We wanna get justice, but this isn't the way to do it.
You have no idea what he's done.
How about trafficking underage girls? He was behind a case we just broke.
16-year-old runaway.
We managed to help her, but there were others we couldn't save.
We can rescue them, then take down Pajaro's entire operation, but not if you kill him.
He can't hurt another girl.
He won't.
You have our word.
Ahem.
All right.
I got confirmation.
The prints on that shot glass are Nestor Rodrigo's.
Just so we're clear, Eve, you're accusing one of the biggest developers in South Florida of trafficking kids.
You're sure this is the same guy? Before Rodrigo was on magazine covers, he led a death squad in El Salvador.
I know because I saw him with my own eyes.
Gloria dared me to sneak into the chapel at the orphanage.
There was a wooden angel on the altar, and we were gonna carve our initials in the back of it.
That's when the trucks came.
Pajaro was there to steal the girls And he murdered the nuns and the boys.
They wore masks and attacked without warning.
Wait.
If Rodrigo wore a mask, how can you be sure it's him? I have an angel to thank for that.
We hid under the altar.
Gloria was clutching her butterfly box so tight, I thought she'd break it.
Pajaro came in to search the chapel, and that's when I saw his face, and so did Gloria.
I knew what he was gonna do with us, so I hit him with the angel.
Uhh! And then we ran for our lives.
The faces of the girls we left behind still haunt me.
Is that why you and Gloria made your pact to kill Pajaro? I get it.
You wanted him to pay.
How are we gonna nail this guy? We aren't.
Abby, Bos, and I will take it from here.
What? This isn't about revenge, Eve.
If we're gonna shut down Rodrigo's operation, we need him alive.
About tonight, I'm sorry.
Too late.
You're benched.
Rodrigo's been giving the cops the middle finger for years.
We don't exactly play by the rules either.
Yeah, we're angels, not saints.
I ran Nestor Rodrigo past my intelligence sources.
Let me guess.
He's squeaky-clean.
Spotless.
Sarah Daniels is the only one of Pajaro's victims that has ever been saved.
Abby, was she able to give you any insight? She said she was chained to some other girls.
Most of them were speaking Spanish.
Here's an interesting fact.
His foundation builds orphanages in central America.
Rodrigo must be using it to funnel girls into the country for trafficking.
I squeegeed his database.
Somehow he's keeping all of his illegal activity off the grid.
The man runs a criminal enterprise in the 21st century.
The information has to be there somewhere.
Actually, it's in someone.
Her name is Nadia Kozlova.
She has a photographic memory.
One of my buddies at MI told me about her.
Thought she was an urban legend.
She absconded with $14 million from the Russian mob.
Rodrigo's bodyguards aren't only for his protection.
They're for hers.
They go with her everywhere, except inside his star island compound.
Did we say that you were benched or no? Actually, I thought miss French could assist you.
Gloria was the only family I had.
I wanna help.
It's fortunate for you that I believe in second chances.
Don't let me down.
I won't.
Is this okay with you guys? It's Charlie's call.
According to his Twitter feed, Rodrigo is hosting a charity fund-raiser at his mansion tomorrow night.
Theme is heaven and hell.
Sounds like we'll blend right in.
Big party, lots of security distractions.
We go undercover and grab Nadia.
Hate to buzzkill the plan, but don't you think police might consider that kidnapping? The police need evidence.
I only need certainty.
Nadia is the best way to link Rodrigo to his crimes and take him down.
Watch your backs, angels.
Good-bye, Charlie.
Thanks, Charlie.
Good-bye, Charlie.
Bye.
Let me introduce you to my party people in the club la-la-la la la la la la la la la la la la la tonight we gon' be it on the floor la-la-la la la la la la la la la la la la la tonight we gon' be it on the floor There's Rodrigo.
Bos, are you set? Truck's in position in the back by the bathrooms.
Once the spray hits Nadia's stomach, she'll start cramping within 30 seconds.
When she heads to the bathroom, that's when we'll grab her and get her to the catering truck.
Eve, stay on Rodrigo.
Let us know if he moves.
Got it.
Get on the floor straight to L.
A.
, New York Vegas to Africa Abbs? Hmm? You wanna take the first shot at Nadia? She's right by the ice sculpture.
Hmm.
Can hardly tell the two apart.
Looks just like her.
Abby Sampson? Bridget and Priscella.
Uh, Dalton prep? Uh, yeah.
The Wentworth sisters.
Sure.
Hi.
It's been, uh, it's been forever.
Yeah, cute outfit.
Uh Are you one of the servers? Yeah.
Yeah.
Recession's a bitch, you know.
Oh.
Considering what your father did, I'd call it payback.
Do you know how much money he screwed our Uncle out of? Uh, no idea.
I, uh, I haven't spoken to my dad in Oh.
That's for my Facebook page.
I'm sure all your old Dalton friends would love to see what you've been up to.
Yeah.
Blini? Ooh! Yeah.
Oh, sure.
Thanks.
Bye.
You are so welcome.
Nice friends.
Yeah.
You all right? I will be in about 30 seconds.
Oh, my God.
Instant ex-lax.
Well, at least we know the gut juice works.
No wonder Gloria liked you.
You're up next, Kate.
Hors d'oeuvre? No, thank you.
We missed our window.
Time for plan ""B.
"" As in, uh, plan Bosley? Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We never fully discussed plan Bosley.
Well, we know her deal with Rodrigo is strictly business.
But Charlie's intel suggests she has a healthy appetite for the opposite sex.
I'd say Bosley trumps Beluga any day of the week.
I'll meet you at the catering truck.
All right.
That's the total number of guests.
58 servers, 29 busboys, 16 valets, 2 ice sculptures, and one very beautiful woman.
What are you? Doctor, lawyer, Internet billionaire? Starving grad student.
My buddy's one of the caterers, so I tagged along for the free food and to watch the rich and famous in their natural habitat.
And what do you think of the wildlife so far? Just got more exotic.
Guys, Rodrigo's on the move.
He could be looking for Nadia.
Bos, time to put the party on wheels.
Get Nadia to the catering truck.
Why don't we find a place with a little more privacy? Yeah.
The guest house is on the other end of the compound.
My buddy's catering truck's right there.
Down and dirty's not my style.
Okay.
Okay.
Not down and dirty.
We'll keep it nice and clean.
You have five seconds to tell me who you really are.
Fine.
I'm a heartbreaker.
Uhh! Ahh.
Nice job, Casanova.
Took you long enough.
Guys, I lost rodrigo.
Never mind.
We got Nadia.
Just get changed and get the hell out of there.
Oh! (Chuckles) See? I knew the devil would get me eventually.
Eve, where are you? Coming.
Eve, we have to move now.
I'm delayed.
Don't wait.
Let's go.
I kept that as a reminder of when I let two little girls get away.
You killed my best friend.
It was her own fault.
She should've left the past alone.
Nadia's missing.
Your past is about to catch up with you Pajaro.
Hmm.
Ohh! Eve, can you hear me? What have we here? You're full of surprises.
Eve, are you there? Ah! Once I bring the ice princess out of sleep mode, she's all yours, detective.
Hi.
Easy.
The captain hasn't turned off the ""fasten seat belt"" sign.
Where are you taking me? You're 25,000 feet above the Atlantic en route to St.
Petersburg.
Ripping off a Russian crime boss wasn't exactly the smartest idea.
Petrovski sent you? These days, he hires pretty girls to do a man's job.
You hear that, Abbs? She called us pretty.
Such a sweetheart.
Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it.
So turn the plane around.
Rodrigo grabbed one of our team.
Where would he take her? As soon as we land in Miami, I'll tell you.
You're lying.
She'll be dead by then.
It's my best offer.
Here's some in-flight entertainment.
It's a home movie of the last guy who crossed petrovski.
Hope you're not squeamish.
Now that guy is an artist with a nail gun.
You think that scares me? Hmm? Well, you should hear what he has in store for you.
If it makes you feel any better, he's all bent up about having to kill his little babushka.
Isn't that what he used to call you? How did you know that? Enjoy your flight.
Oh, wait.
Flamingo boat yard.
He would have taken your friends there.
Okay, Bos, it's time to bail.
Don't open that door! Are you insane? Hey, relax.
At least you're n in coach.
Who took Nadia? Tell me where they took Nadia.
Who took Nadia?! You had enough? Hmm? Just getting Warmed up.
Just getting warmed up.
Oh, my God.
Look.
This is where Rodrigo must be storing the girls he traffics.
Eve's running out of time.
We gotta move now.
New plan.
You get the girls.
I'll get Eve.
Go.
Uhh! Aah! Who took Nadia?! Tell me who took Nadia! Who took Nadia? Nadia's not as tough as this one.
She'll break.
Time to slash and burn.
And kill her.
Uhh! Bos! Uhh! Come on! You'll spend the rest of your life in a cage.
That's what you deserve, Pajaro.
Aha.
Thought I might find you here.
Gloria's Uncle used to own this garage, right? Yeah.
I rebuilt my first engine here when I was 13.
But you're not here to talk about cars.
Charlie told me he called you.
Came by to see if you've considered his offer.
Yeah.
Um I'm just not sure why he'd want me.
Well, he keeps his criteria close to the vest.
My bet he's impressed with your abilities to adapt to situations, your above average driving skills, and the fact that your employment options are extremely limited.
Mm, yes, is that how he got you? I was staring at a 20-year sentence for tax fraud.
Planted a virus in the I.
R.
S.
Mainframe, skimmed a penny off everybody's tax return.
My own personal stimulus package.
I've already done my time, and working for a voice in a box isn't really my style.
First rule of the Townsend agency zero face time with the boss.
Tell him I appreciate the offer, but it's not for me.
You know why Charlie calls the women who work for him ""angels""? Why? Because they show up when you least expect it when you need them the most.
Trust me.
I'm no angel.
Why? Because you have a past you're not proud of? Look at this as your second chance, like the one you gave Gloria.
She was with you the night you were arrested, but you let her walk away from the accident before the cops showed up.
She had always protected me.
I wanted to protect her.
Besides, she's the only family I had.
We're a family, too.
I think you could use one of those right now.
It's Charlie.
Take my advice.
Answer the call.
don't need your sad face, sorry, baby but I made up my mind The hours can be long.
And Kate can be really bossy.
Oh! And Abby will overshare and want to borrow all your clothes.
She's right, and I totally have dibs on those shoes.
Just remember.
We earn our wings together.
Turnin' up the, turnin' up the beat I'm ready.
Welcome to the angels.
I'm like a brand new chick Somebody would like to say hello.
you wouldn't recognize me I trust you're all enjoying my yacht.
It's amazing.
The only thing we're missing is the owner.
We were hoping you would drop in on the celebration, Charlie.
Not today, angels, but know I'm always a phone call away.
Cheers.
My face to the sky, sunglasses on turnin' up the beat so sick yeah, yeah I'm like a brand new turnin' up the, turnin' up the turnin' up the beat so sick",fail
23,Bleep My Dad Says,"Mom? Hey, I need your help.
I'm at dad's.
Because I need to borrow money.
I got laid off.
I'm broke.
[Suspenseful music.]
You were married to the guy.
What's the best way to get money from him? Yeah.
I can't divorce him.
I'm over-thinking this.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Maybe he's a different guy.
Maybe he's mellowed.
You know what? I bet he's changed.
Guts or nuts.
Your choice.
[Whispers.]
He hasn't changed.
[Ben folds five's one angry dwarf and solemn faces.]
Don't you think you wanna be just a little more like me Why didn't you call first? Almost decorated my Buick with your balls! Come on, dad.
You wouldn't do that to your Buick.
I thought you were one of those jackasses who show up on my front door lookin' for a handout.
Right.
The elections are coming up.
I'm talking about the girl scouts.
They're nothing but beggars with merit badges.
There's nothing worse than someone coming to your home, trying to get money out of you.
What brings you to town, Henry? Um you know, I just I thought you and I could talk face-to-face.
Here's my face.
Talk.
Okay.
This isn't easy for me to say.
Dad, there comes a time in a young man's life Son, are you coming out to me? Because you wouldn't last a minute in that world.
Your skin's too pasty.
You can't dance.
I'm not gay, dad.
But thanks for letting me know I'd suck at it.
Then what do you want? I just w mom says hi.
She's in Italy.
What's that got to do with anything? She was on the phone with me.
Uh, she's doing the Eat Pray love tour.
Although I told her if she wants to get to the love part, she'd better do a lot more praying and a lot less eating.
What's that, a joke? You think it's funny to insult the woman who pushed a giant moron through a tiny opening? I did and then your visual kind of killed it for me.
Are we done here? 'Cause I'm going back to bed.
- It's the middle of the night! - It's 9:00.
There's still kids playing outside.
Then play with them.
I'm going to bed! Okay.
Well, if it's all right with you, I'll just crash on the couch? There's a cot in the attic.
- The couch is fine.
- I know the couch is fine.
That's why I don't want you to sleep in it.
What are we doing here, playing let's make a deal? There's no choice! The cot is in the attic.
Take it or leave.
I'm going to bed.
Wait.
I just want to talk to you for a minute.
You got ten seconds.
Okay.
Here it goes.
Dad, there comes a time in a young man's life Good night.
Blitzer, you smug son of a bitch.
That's not news.
An old guy died.
So what? Now, if he does something tomorrow, that's news.
Morning, dad.
[groans.]
Why are you walking around like you're in your third trimester? I'm about to push a giant complaint through a tiny opening.
That cot is really uncomfortable.
You're too good for that cot now? A Navy buddy of mine died on that cot.
That would explain the big dark stain at the neck.
It's not at the neck.
I turned the bed around.
Quite a guest room you got there, dad.
Did you hear that noise coming from the garden at 5:00 in the morning? Sounded like two animals fighting.
It was.
Me and a raccoon.
I caught him trying to eat one of my cucumbers.
I grabbed him by the tail and I windmilled him into the shed.
Let him think about what he's done.
Anything else you wanna complain about? I'm not complaining.
That's not what I'm doing.
Garden looks great.
Cucumbers are huge.
It's like the land of the lost out there.
You should see my zucchini.
I think I did last night when you answered the door in your jammies.
Your brother and Bonnie are stopping by to drop off some groceries and say hi.
Great.
Um Do you know how long they're gonna be staying? I was hoping you and I can get some one-on-one time.
Why? Wanna braid each other's hair and talk about boys? No, it's not that, dad.
I just I it doesn't matter.
What's with the driver's manual? Oh my license expires when I turn 72 next week, and they're making me take the whole damn test again.
If I don't pass, I lose my license for five years.
Well, look, worse comes to worst, we get you a bike.
It'll keep you in shape.
A bike? Take a look out that window.
Does that look like Bangkok? I'm not getting on any bike! [Singsong.]
Knock, knock.
- Shut the door.
- How 'bout hi? Hi.
Shut the door.
Look at this.
San Diego's king and queen of condos.
Aw, come on, it's not like we have three townhouses in Escrow.
Because we have four.
Including one that had a murder in it.
Whassup? And don't get up for your daughter-in-law.
I'm just holding 20 pounds of your groceries.
- Did you get my fiber bars? - Yes.
- Did you get my fiber bread? - Of course.
Did you get my high fiber pasta? Yes, you'll be very happy, Ed.
It'll feel like you're pulling a shipyard rope through your intestines.
Henry.
Come here.
Come on.
Come hug your brother from another mother.
What's up, Vince? So how are things at the magazine? I got laid off and dad doesn't know.
Dad doesn't know what? How hungry I am.
Dad doesn't care.
I see the manual's out.
I'm glad you've been studying.
Yeah, I've been studying.
But, you know, it's hard to retain.
You get older, the stuff you wanna keep in you flows outta you, stuff you want to flow outta you stays in you.
Lovely sentiment.
I'm sure you're gonna pass it.
Well, I have to pass, because if I don't, I won't be able to drive, and I'll be stranded out here all by myself.
Pop.
You can always live with us right, Bonnie? I'm sorry, he-can-always-what-now? Well, that's something to think about.
- Where ya going? - Where I do all my thinking.
Are you crazy? You just asked him to move in with us? Sweetheart, come on, relax.
That's just something you say.
He's never gonna take us up on the offer.
Well, what if he does? Can you imagine him living in our condo? Think about it.
Think about our sex life! All the high-pitched squealing, all the weeping.
You wouldn't be able to do that anymore! So what happened with the job? The magazine went under.
I got laid off.
I'm broke.
Went through all my savings, and now I have to borrow money from dad, and I don't know how the hell I'm gonna do it.
What's the big deal? Just ask him.
I keep trying, but every time I'm about to ask him, I I just feel like I'm gonna disappoint him.
Henry, he's your father.
Of course you're gonna disappoint him.
Mother Teresa would disappoint him.
She did.
Remember when he met her, Vin? He said it was like talking to a fig wrapped in a napkin.
I don't see what the big deal is.
So you disappoint him, so what? I disappoint him every minute of every day.
It's different for you, Vince.
You grew up with dad.
I don't have a relationship with the guy.
Is that what you want? I didn't think so, but then I see him and, yeah, I guess I do.
Just wish he gave a crap.
Henry, what exactly are you looking for? Anything.
Just something that shows that he wants a relationship with me.
Like what, you want him to play Peter Gabriel on a boom box outside your window? I don't Just a gesture.
Any kind of gesture.
Okay, I have news for you, Henry.
The only gesture your father makes is when someone cuts him off on the freeway.
The gesture you're looking for ain't happenin'.
So you just gotta be nice to him, ask him for the money, restart your life.
[Exhales.]
[Billie Holiday's but not for me plays.]
they're writing songs of love Okay, dishes are done.
I swept the floors, wiped down the counters, so they look nice.
Nice, nice, nice.
I need to disinfect.
Son, sit down.
The house is clean enough.
We didn't accidentally kill a hooker.
We had brunch.
You know what? You're right.
Hey.
How 'bout we study for your driver's test? Good.
All right.
Okay.
You're involved in a minor traffic collision with a parked car, and you are unable to locate the owner.
- You must, ""a"" - What part of town am I in? I don't know.
Downtown.
It's not that important.
I don't like downtown.
It smells of motor oil and hummus.
Fine.
Then you're at the store down the street.
Which store? The one with the slow kid who works in produce? No.
The other one.
You know, I like the one with the slow kid.
He knows his vegetables.
Dad, you were a Navy doctor.
You performed surgeries in war zones.
Why can't you focus? It had to be you Go on.
I'm focused.
No.
It's the song.
What do you know about it? - I know.
- You don't know.
That's the song you and mom used to dance to.
How do you know that? You were five when we split up.
Guess, uh you just remember some things.
- What do you need, Henry? - What do you mean? Well, you been around all day.
You cleaned the house, helped me study.
What do you need? Money? Wow.
You really ha ha.
I'm just being nice to my dad, that's all.
Son if it looks like manure and smells like manure, it's either wolf blitzer or manure.
Would you stop looking for reasons to be disappointed in me? Stop giving me reasons for being disappointed.
What reasons? I did everything right.
I did well in college.
I got a good job at a magazine.
The thing went under, and yes, I got laid off.
I got college loans to pay.
So what? I need a little help.
Newsflash, dad.
So does half the country.
You know, son, I'd have had a lot more respect for you if you'd come right out and told me what you needed like a man.
If I wanted somebody to be nice to me for money, I'd have rented out the back room at the winking oyster.
That is so typically you.
You love to be needed, dad, but when someone actually needs you, you lose respect for them.
Which brings me to my original question what do you need? What do I need? I need a dad who would for once, just once, let me walk out of his home without feeling worse than when I walked in.
- You're being dramatic.
- Dramatic? I haven't seen you in two years.
You don't even give me a bed to sleep on! You put me in the attic on a tiny cot that has a bloodstain that is a bloodstain, right? I need to hear you tell me it's a bloodstain.
It is a bloods don't tell me.
I treat you no differently than anybody else.
Exactly! I'm not anyone else! I'm your son.
You're supposed to build me up, not tear me down.
- I build you up.
- Really? Did you build me up that time I got a haircut and you told me I looked like a lesbian in the Navy? A lesbian in the Navy saved my life! Did you build me up when you told me that my one and only father's day poem to you was an affront to the English language? - It was! - I was eight! Even an eight-year-old knows you don't rhyme dad with bat! Okay, if you ever wonder why you don't have a relationship with your kids, this is why.
I have a perfectly fine relationship with Vince.
Just today, he asked me to come and live with him and his wife.
I guarantee if you actually took him up on the offer, they'd freak.
You're wrong.
They wouldn't know what to say! It would just be gibberish coming out of their mouths.
You don't know what you're talking about.
And let me give you a piece of advice if you're gonna kiss my ass for money, at least put on a nice shade of lipstick.
I don't even know what that means! And is that really the only reason you think I'm here for money? [Billie Holiday continues in background.]
Am I wrong? No, dad.
You're not wrong.
You're right.
You're always right.
You know what your reward is for being right? Being alone.
And I'd keep an eye on your cucumbers.
I let the raccoon out.
He's on the front porch and looks pissed, so I'm gonna go out the back door.
It had to be you You know, Henry said something that set me thinking.
I'm all alone out here, rattling around in this old house, so I thought maybe I'd sell the place, take you up on your offer, and come live with you.
What do you say? [Both muttering.]
I could take the guest room in the back of the house.
You wouldn't even know I was there.
- Hmm - Blll uh .
I would help with the mortgage payments and my share of the household expenses.
- Uh, mortgage - I I Although I can't leave this house.
My things are here and the garden's here.
So thanks for the offer, but I'm not gonna come and live with you.
Oh, are you sure, Ed.
'Cause we have that extra room.
[Horn honks.]
Can you tell me what the topmost image is? Two squirrels fornicating.
What the hell does it look like? It's a gigantic ""E.
"" And the line below that? Why do I have to keep identifying letters? I've been driving for 60 years, and I've never been rear-ended by a gigantic ""E""! Clearly, you've never driven down Sesame Street.
Mm, mm, mm.
Sss! Ooh! Oh! Oh! Would you look at that? You failed by one teeny, tiny point.
That is such a shame.
Guess we won't be seeing your pleasant face for another five years.
What do you mean, I failed? Yeah.
Maybe you can get one of those motorized scooters that my morbidly obese aunt uses.
Next! You can't fail me.
I've got to be able to drive.
No, no, no.
I can.
It's kinda my job.
But I'm sure you're surrounded by people that love you and are dying to drive you wherever you wanna go, given that you are such a delight.
- Next.
- I don't have any people.
Oh, come on.
No, I have no one.
Boy, I've really screwed up.
Look, it's just a driving test.
I'm not talking about the driving test.
I'm sorry I was rude to you.
You didn't deserve it.
You were just doing your job.
You seem like a perfectly nice homosexual.
I'd like to think that I am.
I'll let you get on with your job.
Wait.
Don't you have any family that can drive you where you need to go? - Any kids? - Yeah, but I've screwed that up too.
I'll let you carry on.
Wait! I can't believe I'm doing this.
Oops.
There.
71.
You passed! Thank you.
You know, my dad screwed up with me.
Then you know what happened? He fixed it.
That's the thing no matter how old your kids get, it's never too late to be a dad.
Here, you know, I - I'd like you to have this.
- What is it? Means a great deal to me.
They gave it to me in 'Nam for sewing a guy's sack back on.
[Door closes.]
Henry! Hi, dad.
You wanna come and sit down, have a bowl of grape nuts? Got a little gift for ya.
Honestly, I don't want anything.
I just came by to get my stuff.
I'm leaving.
Um my buddy's gonna let me crash on his couch.
- Where? - L.
A.
- When? - Now.
- Why? - Because.
I see So I'm gonna get my stuff now.
Okay.
Okay.

- Why not? - I'm going.
- Where? - L.
A.
- When? - Now! - Why? Because! I see You know you might wanna stick around.
You might like what I got you.
You're not getting it.
This isn't happening.
It was a bad idea for me to come here.
I was looking for something that doesn't exist.
So now I'm leaving.
I don't want anything from you.
Enjoy your life.
Fine.
You're gonna go, go! For the record, I never got ya a gift.
I never asked for one.
[Knock on door.]
Well, I didn't get one.
Fine.
[Knocking.]
- You gonna get that? - Get what? - There's someone at the door.
- I didn't hear anything.
[Doorbell rings.]
I didn't hear that either.
Good luck, Henry.
Dad, why aren't you answering the door? - Which door? - Oh, my God.
I'll get the door.
- I got a mattress delivery.
- Wrong house! An Ed Goodson doesn't live here? Very common name.
""Edison Milford Goodson III""? A somewhat common name.
Dad? Is this the gift? No.
They've obviously made a mistake.
Card says, ""to Henry.
Enjoy this gift.
Dad.
"" This is getting very eerie.
Dad Why did you get me a bed? You were complaining about the bed, so I got you a bed.
- For what? - To sleep.
- Where? - Upstairs.
- When? - Tonight.
- Why? - Because! I see Dad is this your way of asking me to live here? Why would I want you to live here? You're a pain in the ass who only wants my money.
You're like a girl scout without the cookies! I'm gonna get my stuff.
[Quietly.]
Just a gesture.
Excuse me? It was a gesture, the bed.
It was just a gesture.
Why does everything have to be said? We'll take the bed.
Thank you.
I'd wait to thank me until you see where I put the raccoon.
What the hell are you doing? Come on, dad.
If I'm gonna be living here, I gotta be able to use your record player.
Well, gentle, damn it.
It's not a pair of boobs on one of your sweaty dates.
It had to be you Remember this? It had to be [imitating Ed.]
Spin, sway.
Come on, Barb, stay with me! Why can't someone do a good impression of me? If you're gonna do it, do it right.
It had to be you Spin, spin.
[Along with billie.]
it had to be you Sway, sway.
I told you Vince wasn't gonna let you live with him.
He's so full of it.
Don't criticize your brother.
He does the best he can.
Yeah.
I guess we all just do the best we can.
Not you.
You can do better.
There's still hope for you.
Thanks, dad.
You know, you can be a really nice guy when you wanna be.
[Knock on door.]
Who is it? Girl: Girl scouts.
Would you like some cookies? It's shotgun time!",fail
24,Modern Family,"Kids, breakfast! Kids? Phil, would you get them? Yeah, just a sec.
That is so - Kids, get down here! Why are you guys yelling at us? When we're way upstairs, just text me.
All right, that's not gonna happen, and, wow, you're not wearing that outfit.
What's wrong with it? - Honey, do you have anything to say to your daughter about her skirt? Sorry? Oh yeah, that looks really cute, sweetheart! Thanks! - No, it's way too short, people know you're a girl you don't need to prove it to them.
Luke got his head stuck in the banister again.
I got it.
Where's the babyoil? - It's on our bedside tab I don't know, find it.
Come on! Iwas out of control growing up.
There, you know, I said it.
I just don't want my kids to make the same bad mistakes I made.
If Hayley never wakes up on a beach in Florida, half-naked I've done my job.
OUR job.
- Right I've done our job.
That was a penalty! Gloria, they're 0 and 6, let's take it down a notch.
We're very different.
He's from the city.
He has big business.
I come from a small village.
Very poor, but very, very beautiful.
It's the number one village in north Columbia for all the what's the word? - Murders.
Yes, the murders.
Manny, stop him! Damn it, Manny! Come on, coach! You've gotta take that kid out! You wanna take him out? How about I take you out!? Honey, honey Why don't you worry about your son! He'd spend the first half with his hands in his pants! I wanted to tell her that for the last six weeks I'm Josh, Brian's dad.
- Hi, I'm Gloria Pritchett Manny's mother.
Oh, this must be your dad.
Her dad? Uh, no, no, that's funny.
Actually, no.

Actually no, I'm her husband! Don't be fooled by the Give me a second here.
She's adorable! - Oh, thank you! Hi, Precious - Hello.
We've just adopted her from Vietnam and we're bringing her home for the first time.
She's an angel.
You and you're wife must be thrilled! Sorry, sorry, sorry, daddy needed snacks.
So, what are we talking about? We have been together for five years now? And we decided we really wanted to have a baby so, we initially asked one of our lesbian friends to be a surrogate Then we figured, they're already mean enough, can you imagine one of them pregnant? No, thank you.
You saw that right? Everybody fonding up to Lillian, then you walk on and suddenly it's all I'm gonna give a speech.
- You are not giving a speech you gonna stuck with this people for the next five hours! - You're right, it's okay, I'm sorry.
Honey, look at that baby with those creampuffs.
Okay, excuse me.
But this baby would be growing up in a crowded orphanage if it wasn't for us creampuffs and you know what, to all of you who judge, hear this, love knows no race, creed or gender and shame on you! You small minded, ignorant fe- Mitchell? - What? She's got the creampuffs.
We would like to pay for everyone's headsets.
MODERN FAMILY SEASON 1 EPISODE 1 Buddy, why do you keep getting stuk like this? I can get out this time.
I'm just gonna say it he needs to be checked by a specialist.
There! Be free, Excalibur! I'm having a friend over today.
- Who? You don't know him.
- Him? Ooh, a boy! You gonna kiss him? - Shut up.
Luke, Alex, why don't you take it outside, okay? - And do what? Fighting a son, it would be a nice change.
I'm kidding! Who's the boy? - His name is Dylan I might as well just tell him not to come, because you guys are just going to embarrass me again.
Hang on a second, you're fifteen, it's the first time you've had a boy over.
I'm bound to be a little suprised, but We're not gonna embarrass you! I'd better go charge the camcorder.
I'm kidding! Come on! Who are you talking to? I'm a cool dad.
That's my thang.
I surf the web, I text.
LOL, Laugh Out Loud, OMG, Oh My God WTF, Why The Face You know, I know all the dances to High School Musical, so.
MOM! DAD! - What happend? Luke just shot me! - I didn't mean to! Are you okay? - No, the little bitch shot me! Language! They're only plastic bb's! It was an accident! What did I tell you what happened if you got him a gun? Deal with this! Buddy Uncool.
That's it? No, the agreement was that if he shoots someone you shoot him.
We were serious about that? Yes, we were and now you have to follow through.
I'm so sorry! - Liar.
Go! - He's got a birthday party.
What's more importand here, dad? You can shoot him afterwards, he'll be home at two.
- I can't shoot him at two, showing our house at two.
What about three? No, he's at a soccergame at three, and then Oh, we gotta leave for that dinner thing in five.
- Yeah, I guess that works for me.
Shoot Luke.
- Sorry dude, it's on the calendar.
Oh, come on! I'm quitting soccer, it is a game for children.
No, you're not quitting.
You would've stopped that goal if you weren't staring at that little girl.
She is not a girl, she is a woman.
You know Gloria, that blowup with that other mom, why do you have to do things like that? If someone sais somthing about my family, I'm going to - I'm just saying you could take it down here a little bit.
- Well yeah, but that's when you live down here but I live up here! You don't have to be so emotional all the time, that's all I'm saying.
Manny, you're with me on this, right? - I wanna tell Brenda Feldman I love her.
Oh, for God's sake.
Honey, she's 16.
- Oh, it's okay for you to take another lover? Watch it! I want to go to the mall where she works.
But first we need to get my white shirt, the silk one.
Okay, if that's what you really want to do.
Seriously, not to be the evil stepdad, but if you put on a puffy white shirt and declare your love for a 16-year-old you're gonna be swinging from the flagpole in your puffy white underpants! Stop the car! Where you going? You hurt his feelings.
- Well, if it toughens him up a little bit, then oh, jeez, he's picking flowers! Manny is verry passionate, just like his father.
My first husband is very handsome, but too crazy.
It seemed like all what we did was fight and make love.
One time, I'm not kidding you, we fell out of the window together.
Which one were you doing? I'm hearing this for the first time! This doesn't worry you? She barely slept in the plane, and she's stil wide awake.
- Oh, stop worrying! That orphanage, it was all woman.
Maybe she can't fall asleep unless she feels a woman's shape.
I guess that's possible.
So, here.
- What the hell is that suppose to mean? Yes, I've gained a few extra pounds while we expecting the baby.
Which has been very difficult.
But, apparently your body does a nesting, very maternal primal thing, were it retains nutrients.
Some sort of molecular physiology thing.
But that's science, you can't fight it.
I'm not saying anything.
You're saying everything.
Count to three, one, t - Three.
- Okay.
Oh my God, do you love it? -Yes, I What the hell is that? I had Andre do it when we we were gone.
Is that us? With wings? We're floating above her, always there to protect her.
Well, that's reassuring, right Lilly? Yeah, we tore you away from everyting you know, but don't worry, things are normal here.
Your fathers are floating fairies! Can you call Andre? Have him paint someting a little less gay? We need to stop having friends with names like Andre.
Redheaded dad is angry daddy.
- No I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
Even Pepper pointed it out on the way home from the airport.
- Okay, that's another one, Pepper! Okay, what's up? I I never told my family we were adopting a baby.
I know.
- You do? And I don't blame you, I know your family.
You tell them, they say something judgemental.
Exactly! - You get mad.
I know, and it's supposed to be nothing, but joyful suddenly turns into this huge fight.
Who wants a big emotional scene like that? Thank you, I'm so relieved you understand.
I invited them over for dinner tonight.
What? - I had to! This would have gone on forever.
You're an avoider.
No, I'm calling them now, I'm cancelling.
- No, you're not! You're telling your family you've adopted a baby, tonight.
And you do have avoidance issues; even Langina said so! Are you really not hearing these names? Don't answer it, i'll get it! Hey, you must be Dylan.
- Hey, Dylan, yeah.
I'm Haley's mother.
Hey, now, let's go.
Hang on one second.
Dylan You're still in High School? - Yeah, I'm a Senior.
Phil, sweetie, honey.
He is Dylan and he is a seniorand you need to scare him.
Let me meet this playa.
Phil Dunphy, yo! It's like that, you just start down on him and let the eyes do the work.
Your mouth might be saying: Hey, we cool! But your eyes are like: No, we not! Nice to meet you! No, it's not! 'S all good? No, 's it is'n Yo.
- Yo.
Okay, I've seen you guys- - Wait You two two keep it real? You k'now what it mean, son? Not really.
Please stop.
- That's cool! Oh, God, that's my back! Ow, oh, I slipped in the baby oil.
Ooh, where you from originally? I could defeat you if it came to a physical confrontation! I don't know about this, shall I call a doctor? - No, no, no, no.
You're verry strong, homes.
- Thanks.
Okay, nice, nice soft landing Okay, I am on my side, so flip me right back and we're good.
We'll be good.
I just need to get flipped right on my back, we should be fine, so.
Brenda Feldman.
What is that? - A poem i've written for Brenda Feldman.
Of course that is.
- I put my thoughts into words, and now my words into action! 'Ey, I give you 50 bucks not to do this.
I'm eleven years old, what am I gonna do with money? What are you gonna do with a sixteen year old? It's like a bullfight! Ever see a bullfight? I can't watch this.
You're in such a bad mood.
And I know why.
It's because that man thought you were my father.
- No.
- Yes.
- NO.
When you say no like that, it's always yes.
Come on, we're in the mall, let's get you, like, some younger clothes there's a store there that I know - I don't need any younger clothes! And I don't care what some jackass in a pair of ripped jeans thinks about me.
Good, you shouldn't.
You should only care what I think.
I love you, and I don't care how old you are.
So stop being a gloomy goose, and stop being so hard on Manny.
- The only reason I'm hard on Manny is just because I don't wanna see him make a fool of himself.
And I can smell that hairgoo of his from here! Look, I don't know what's gonna happen to him over there but you're his family now.
And that means only one thing.
You be there wind in his back, not the spit in his face! What? Something my mom always says, it's gorgeous in Spanish.
Look, he's there.
She has a boyfriend.
I gave her my heart.
She gave me a picture of me as an old-time sheriff.
That was pretty stupid of me, wasn't it? No, mi amore, it was brave, right, Jay? Brave.
I b you'll know better next time.
Come on! Let's get a pretzel.
Oh, excuse me, sir? We ask that all mall-walkers stay to the right.
Alex, get out! MOM! Alex, leave your sister alone! I was just getting my book, gosh! - I know sweetie, but you need to respect their privacy.
- What are they doing up there? - Nothing, lying in her bed, watching a movie.
Okay Okay I'm making a cake for tonight, you wanna help me with the frosting? Sure.
So, you know if Haley got pregnant, would you ever pretend she got mono for a few months and then tell everyone the baby's yours? What? A senior at school was out sick for four months, but she was out breastfeeding in an cleanup carwash.
Buddy, what are you wearing? - Nothing.
No jacket, no hat.
How many pairs of underwear do you have on? - One Six.
First of all, it would be really cool to see Haley that fat, and how awesome would it be to have a fake little brother who's really my nephew? Haley is not getting pregnant! I'm just saying if.
I know, and I know you like to make trouble for your sister, but it's not gonna work this time.
You know why? 'Cause your sister is a good girl.
I know, I was just like her when I was I want you to know, I'm not enjoying this.
This is an important lesson that you're leaning, so.
'S all good, keep it You're too close, it's gonna hurt.
- It's supposed to hurt! And why are you smiling? I'm What? Oh, forget it.
I can't do this.
The point is, you're scared.
I think you've learned your lesson.
Mom?! What are you doing? - Hey, I was just dropping off some laundry, this is a bad time? Yeah Oh, okay.
Can you shut the door, please? Actually, we're just go ahead and leave that open.
Why? Because I have, uh, seen this little show before: Lying on the bed with a tall senior.
one minute you're just friends, watching Falcon Crest, and the next you're lying underneath the air-hockey table with your bra un-pocket! Mom! You hit my bone! - It was an accident! I thought we were friends! - I am your friend! Dad?! Dad, you have got to talk to mom, she is like completely freaking out and emberassing me.
Well, honey, you're mom isn't always as cool about things as I What is with this thing! My dad, isn't completely comfortable with This, ehum, he still does this thing.
It's been five years now.
And he still does this thing were he announces himself before walking into any room were in.
Just to make sure he doesn't ever see us kiss.
Wish my mother had that system.
Remember? - Not now.
I still can't beleve you did this to me! - Would you get in the spirit of things! It's a celebration! Oh God.
I'm gonna go get Lily ready, and I want you to just come straight out with it, you can do this! Sportsguy-chest-bump, sportsguy-chest-bump! Do it, GO! Hey, how are you? Hi, guys! Well thank you, thanks.
- Don't thank us open it, dad is right behind Knock, knock, we're here! Coming in! - Don't worry, dad, nothing gay going on here.
May I take your multicoloured coat and your bejeweled cap? Yeah.
Hey, Jay.
- Gloria, hi! How are you? Hi Gloria, how are you? What a beautiful dress! Thank you, Phil! - Oh, okay.
Phil! She said ""Phil,"" not ""feel!"" So how was your trip? - It was good, it was good, actually, but about that, I have something that I need to tell you guys.
We didn't just go to Vietnam for pleasure.
We kinda have some big news.
Oh, God, if Cam comes out there with boobs, I'm leaving! Dad! - I hope he didn't embarrass you, mom.
Don't mind her, Haley had her first boy over today, and Phil shot him.
Anyway, so about a year ago, Cam and I sort have feeling this longing for something more like, maybe a baby.
Whoa, that's a bad idea.
What do you mean, bad idea? - Well, kids need a mother! I mean, if you two guys are bored, get a dog! We're not bored, dad! I support you, Mitchell, even though you're not my son.
I think what dad is trying to say is that, Mitchell, you're a little uptight, kids bring chaos and you don't handle well.
That's not what's it's saying what you saying.
And it's insulting in an whole different way.
Okay, people, let's all chillax! Where's uncle Cameron? - Finally, thank you, someone who's not insulting me noticed he's not here.
So, that's the big announcement.
You two broke up.
Well a baby wasn't gonna help that, anyway! Let me tell you, you'll be better off, because he was a bit of a drama queen.
Stop, stop, you come into my house and you insult me and my boyfriend, who is, by the way, not that dramatic! We've adopted a baby.
Her name is Lilly Exciting! Just turn it off.
- I can't turn it off, it's who I am! The music! - Oh, yes, the music.
Come say hello, Lilly.
Lilly? Isn't that gonna be hard for her to say? - Phil.
Excuse me Okay, I know that I said I thought this was a bad idea.
But What do I know? I mean, It's not like I wrote the book on fatherhood.
I'm trying whole my life to get it right, I'm still screwing up.
Right, Manny? I wrote a song about it in the car.
- Of course you did.
Anyway, I'm happy for you.
And you should know that I'm not here to spit in your face, I'm here to blow at your back.
It's supposed to sound better in Spanish.
Anyhow, Mitch.
No, dad, it's I got it, I got it.
She wants her daddy.
- Do you wanna meet grandpa? You kidding? She's one of us now! Let me see that little potsticker! Hey, you're a cutie, aren't you! We're from different worlds.
Yet we somehow fit together.
Love is what binds us.

Should we have invited her for lunch? No.
We're gonna start season two of Battlestar Galactica.
We already watched the season two DVDs.
Not with commentary.
I think we should be good neighbors.
Invite her over, make her feel welcome.
We never invited Louie/Louise over.
Well, and that was wrong of us.
We need to widen our circle.
I have a very wide circle.
I have 21 2 friends on MySpace.
Yes, and you've never met one of them.
That's the beauty of it.
I'm gonna invite her over.
We'll have a nice meal and chat.
Chat? We don't chat, at least not off-line.
Well, it's not difficult.
You just listen to what she says.
.
.
.
.
.
and then you say something appropriate in response.
To what end? -Hi.
Again.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Anyway.
.
.
.
.
.
we brought home Indian food.
.
.
.
.
.
and I know that moving can be stressful.
.
.
.
.
.
and I find that when I'm undergoing stress.
.
.
.
.
.
that good food and company can have a comforting effect.
Also, curry's a natural laxative and I don't have to tell you that, you know.
.
.
.
.
.
a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.
I'm no expert, but in the context of a lunch invitation.
.
.
.
.
.
you might wanna skip the reference to bowel movements.
Oh, you're inviting me over to eat? Yes.
Oh, that's so nice.
I'd love to.
Great.
So, what do you guys do for fun around here? Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
-Okay, well, make yourself at home.
-Okay.
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.
You're very welcome.
This looks like some serious stuff.
Leonard, did you do this? Actually, that's my work.
Wow.
Yeah, well, it's just some quantum mechanics .
.
.
with a little string theory doodling around the edges.
That part's just a joke.
It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
So you're, like, one of those Beautiful Mind genius guys.
Yeah.
This is really impressive.
I have a board, if you like boards.
This is my board.
Holy smokes.
If by ""holy smokes,"" you mean a derivative restatement of the stuff.
.
.
.
.
.
you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.
-What? -Oh, come on.
Who hasn't seen this differential below ""here I sit brokenhearted""? At least I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions just to make the math come out.
-I didn't invent them.
They're there.
-In what universe? In all of them, that is the point.
Do you guys mind if I start? -Penny.
-Yeah? That's where I sit.
So sit next to me.
-No, I sit there.
-What's the difference? -What's the difference? -Here we go.
In winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm.
.
.
.
.
.
yet not so close as to cause perspiration.
In the summer, it's in a cross breeze created by opening windows there and there.
It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, discouraging conversation.
.
.
.
.
.
nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion.
I could go on, but I think I've made my point.
Do you want me to move? -Well .
-Just sit somewhere else.
Fine.
Sheldon, sit.
Ah.
Well, this is nice.
We don't have a lot of company over.
That's not true.
Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.
Yes, I know.
Tuesday night we played Klingon Boggle until 1 in the morning.
-Yeah, I remember.
-I resent you saying we don't have company.
-That has a negative social implication.
-I said Iâm sorry.
So .
.
.
Klingon Boggle? Yeah.
It's like regular Boggle, but in Klingon.
That's probably enough about us.
So tell us about you.
Me? Okay.
I'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.
Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion.
.
.
.
.
.
that the sun's position relative to arbitrary constellations .
.
.
at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Participate in the what? I think what Sheldon's trying to say .
.
.
is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.
Oh, yeah, a lot of people think Iâm a water sign.
Okay, let's see, what else? Oh, Iâm a vegetarian.
No, except for fish, and the occasional steak.
I love steak.
Well, that's interesting.
Leonard can't process corn.
So do you have some sort of a job? Oh, yeah.
I'm a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.
I love cheesecake.
-You're lactose intolerant.
-I don't eat it, I think it's a good idea.
Anyways, Iâm also writing a screenplay.
It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.
A.
from Lincoln, Nebraska .
.
.
to be an actress and winds up a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.
So it's based on your life.
No, I'm from Omaha.
If that was a movie, I would go see it.
I know, right? Okay, let's see, what else? I guess that's about it.
That's the story of Penny.
Well, it sounds wonderful.
It was.
Until I fell in love with a jerk.
What is happening? I don't know.
Oh, God, you know, four years I lived with him.
Four years.
That's like as long as high school.
It took you four years to get through high school? I just-- I can't believe I trusted him.
Should I say something? I feel I should say something.
You? No, you'll only make it worse.
You wanna know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts .
.
.
I still love him.
Is that crazy? Yes.
No, it's not crazy.
It's a-- It's a paradox.
Paradoxes are part of nature.
I mean, think about light.
If you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double-slit experiments.
But then, along comes Albert Einstein .
.
.
and discovers that light behaves like particles too.
Well, I didn't make it worse.
Oh, Iâm so sorry I'm such a mess.
And on top of everything else, I'm all gross from moving.
.
.
.
.
.
and my stupid shower doesn't work.
Our shower works.
Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it? -Yes.
-No.
-No? -No.
No.
It's right down the hall.
Okay, thanks.
You guys are really sweet.
Well, this is an interesting development.
How so? It has been some time.
.
.
.
.
.
since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving .
.
.
my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode? Point taken.
It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off.
.
.
.
.
.
after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? Excuse me? That woman in there is not going to have sex with you.
Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.
Oh, good.
Then you won't be disappointed.
What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male and she's a female.
Yes, but not of the same species.
I'm not gonna engage in hypotheticals here.
-I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
-Oh, of course.
That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop .
.
.
that I wouldn't participate.
However briefly.
Do you think this possibility will be hindered.
.
.
.
.
.
when she discovers your Luke Skywalker ""no more tears"" shampoo? It's Darth Vader shampoo.
Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.
-Wait till you see this.
-It's fantastic.
Unbelievable.
See what? It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1 974.
This isn't a good time.
It's before he became .
.
.
a creepy computer voice.
-That's great, you guys have to go.
-Why? -It's just not a good time.
-Leonard has a lady over.
Yeah, right.
Your grandmother back in town? No.
And she's not a lady, she's just a new neighbor.
Hang on, there really is a lady here? -Uh-huh.
-And you want us out.
.
.
.
.
.
because you're anticipating coitus? -I'm not anticipating coitus.
-So she's available for coitus? Can we please just stop saying ""coitus""? Technically, that would be coitus interruptus.
Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower? Oh, hi, sorry.
Hello.
EnchantÃ©, mademoiselle.
Howard Wolowitz, CalTech Department of Applied Physics.
You may be familiar with some of my work.
It's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon .
.
.
taking high-resolution digital photographs.
Penny.
I work at The Cheesecake Factory.
-I'll show you the trick with the shower.
-Okay.
I'm sorry? It's French for ""good shower.
"" It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
Save it for your blog, Howard.
All right, there it goes.
It sticks, Iâm sorry.
-Okay, thanks.
-You're welcome.
Oh, you're just gonna step right--? Okay.
Hey, Leonard? - The hair products are Sheldon's.
Okay.
-Um, can I ask you a favor? -A favor? Sure, you could ask me a favor.
I would do you a favor for you.
-It's okay if you say no.
-Oh, I'll probably say yes.
It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met.
Wow.
I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
-Must we? -Event A: A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower.
We drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set.
.
.
.
.
.
from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend.
On what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link .
.
.
between these events? She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.
Well, that may be the proximal cause of our journey.
.
.
.
.
.
but we both know it exists in contradistinction.
.
.
.
.
.
to the higher-level distal cause.
-Which is? -You think with your penis.
That's a biological impossibility, and you didn't have to come.
Oh, yes.
I could have stayed behind to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny .
.
.
in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.
And why can't she get her own TV? Come on, you know how it is with breakups.
No, I don't, and neither do you.
But l-- I broke up with Joyce Kim.
You did not break up with Joyce Kim.
She defected to North Korea.
To mend her broken heart.
This situation is much less complicated.
There's some dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend.
.
.
.
.
.
as to who gets custody of the TV.
-She just wanted to avoid a scene with him.
-So we get to have a scene with him? No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene.
There's two of us and one of him.
Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.
So you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the university? I'm sorry, do you speak English? Oh, he speaks English.
He just can't speak to women.
Really? Why? He's kind of a nerd.
Juice box? - I'll do the talking.
- Yeah? -Hi.
I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
-Hello.
What did I just--? -We're here to pick up Penny's TV.
-Get lost.
Okay, thanks for your time.
-We're not gonna give up just like that.
-Leonard, the TV's in the building.
We've been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.
Excuse me.
If I were to give up at the first hitch, I never would have identified.
.
.
.
.
.
the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.
My apologies.
What's your plan? It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360.
We should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.
-What do you think their combined IQ is? -Just grab the door.
This is it.
I'll do the talking.
Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.
-Yeah? -I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
From the intercom.
How the hell did you get in the building? We're scientists.
Tell him about our IQ.
-Leonard.
-What? -My mom bought me those pants.
-I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to call her.
Sheldon, I am so sorry I dragged you through this.
It's okay.
It wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last.
And you were right about my motives.
I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny.
.
.
.
.
.
that might have someday led to sex.
Well, you got me out of my pants.
Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.
I've got my work.
One day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.
Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.
And you're certainly not gonna win a Nobel Prize.
This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest.
They have a great house ale.
Wow, cool tiger.
Yeah, I've had him since Level 1 0.
His name is Buttons.
Anyway, if you had your own game character.
.
.
.
.
.
we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.
-That sounds interesting.
-So you'll think about it? Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.
Smooth.
-We're home.
-Oh, my God.
What happened? Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
I'm so sorry.
I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.
No, it was a valid hypothesis.
That was a valid hypo--? What is happening to you? Really, thank you so much for going and trying.
You just-- You're so terrific.
Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay? -Really? Great.
-Thank you.
Okay.
You're not done with her, are you? Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
Not to mention imaginary.
-Is Thai food okay with you, Penny? -Sure.
We can't have Thai, we had Indian for lunch.
-So? -They're both curry-based cuisines.
-So? -It would be gastronomically redundant.
I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
Any ideas, Raj? Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado.
I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me Oh,, baby, baby Don't get hooked on me I don't know your odds in the world as a whole.
.
.
.
.
.
but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable mac daddy.
Baby, don't get hooked on me",success
26,Two and a Half Men,"- So, what do you think? - Wow.
It's for you, right? It's for both of us.
Don't go away.
Don't worry.
There's not enough blood left in my legs to go anywhere.
Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.
Listen, you lousy S.
O.
B.
, I will not be treated like this.
Either you call me, or you are gonna be very, very sorry.
I love you, Monkey Man.
Charlie? Who was that? Damn telemarketers.
A telemarketer who calls you Monkey Man? I'm on some weird list.
Okay, it's a woman I went out with once and she got a little clingy.
You are a bad, bad boy.
And yet, you're always the one getting spanked.
Jeez.
Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.
Charlie, it's Alan.
Your brother.
No big deal, just wanted to touch base.
My wife threw me out, and I'm kind of losing the will to live.
So, when you get a chance, I'd really love to I don't know Alan, I'm sorry to hear about that.
So, where you gonna go, to a hotel? Wow.
Well, yeah, I guess you could stay here.
Okay.
I'll see you when you get here.
We better hurry.
Is she staying over? Because I may have parked behind her.
Twelve years, and she just throws me out.
I mean, what was the point of our wedding vows? You know, ""Till death do us part.
"" Who died? Not me.
Not her.
How did you get in my house? Okay, Charlie, the key in the fake rock only works if it's among other rocks.
Not sitting on your welcome mat.
Excuse me, but if you put the fake rock in with a bunch of other rocks, it's impossible to find when you're drunk.
You know, I'm a good husband.
I'm faithful.
- Is she? - Is she what? Faithful.
Don't be ridiculous.
Judith doesn't even like sex.
I mean, all she kept saying was she feels suffocated, you know? She kept going on and on, ""I'm suffocating.
"" What does that mean, you know? Has a woman ever said that to you? Well, yeah.
But not a woman who doesn't like sex.
And Jake.
This could just destroy Jake.
- Jake? - My son.
Teenagers are pretty sophisticated these days.
He's 10.
- Charlie, I'm going to go.
- No.
You two need to talk.
I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm sorry to hear about you and your wife.
Come on, you leaving isn't gonna bring them back together again.
Look, okay, this is just until things settle out.
A couple of days max.
She will come to her senses.
Yeah.
That's what women do.
Look, you can have the guest room.
I'll grab some sheets.
That's okay.
I brought my own.
You brought your own sheets? I like my sheets.
- Okay, then, good night.
- No, wait.
I mean, we hardly ever talk to each other.
What do you want to talk about, Alan? I don't know.
I was named Chiropractor of the Year by the San Fernando Valley Chiropractic Association.
- Okay, then.
Good night.
- No.
Charlie, what about you? What's going on with you? Well, Alan, there's not much to say.
I make a lot of money for doing very little work.
I sleep with beautiful women who don't ask about my feelings.
I drive a Jag, I live at the beach, and sometimes in the middle of the day, for no reason at all, I like to make myself a big pitcher of margaritas and take a nap out on the sundeck.
- Okay, then.
Good night, Charlie.
- Good night.
Good night, Monkey Man.
Boy, is your eye red.
You should see it from in here.
What are you doing here, Jake? My mom brought me.
Will you take me swimming in the ocean? Can we talk about it after my head stops exploding? Why is your head exploding? Well, I drank a little too much wine last night.
If it makes you feel bad, why do you drink it? Nobody likes a wiseass, Jake.
You have to put $1 in the swear jar.
You said ""ass.
"" Tell you what, here's $20.
That should cover me till lunch.
Now, what I think you need to do is to make a list.
On one side, put what you don't like about our marriage, and on the other side, what you do.
Alan, sometimes when I think about coming home to you, I start crying in my car.
Okay, that would probably go on the ""don't"" side.
Why would I lie? The ocean is closed today.
For God's sake, do you think you could put some pants on? Look at me, Judy.
I could barely make it down the stairs.
Charlie, could you and Jake Yeah, come on, kid, we'll have breakfast out on the deck.
I already had breakfast.
- Okay, we'll have lunch.
- It's not lunchtime.
That's his head exploding.
Judith, I can change.
Please, Alan.
You are the most rigid, inflexible, obsessive, anal-retentive man I've ever met.
Rigid and inflexible? Don't you think that's a little redundant? My mom and dad are splitting up.
Yeah.
It looks that way.
You're lucky.
When I was your age, I could only dream about my parents splitting up.
- Your mom is my grandma.
- Yep.
Grandma says you're a bitter disappointment.
Hey, sport, your mom wants to say goodbye.
Listen, he doesn't know anything about what's going on, so let's just keep this to ourselves.
Our little secret.
Why is she saying goodbye to him? She's gonna be spending the weekend with her sister in Vegas.
So, we decided that Jake would stay with me.
With you? Well, with us.
I'm hungry.
Is this gonna be a problem? I guess not.
Thanks.
Listen, I've got to call my office.
Would you mind making him lunch? - Sure.
- Thanks.
What are you smiling about? You don't have any food.
Yeah, but I'm not the one who's hungry.
Who's smiling now, shorty? - You drink milk? - Just with cereal.
- Okay.
- Not that milk.
That milk.
- What's the difference? - That's Dairy Farm.
We drink Dairy Barn.
Fine.
Happy? Why would I be happy? It's just milk.
Cute.
Keep it up, you'll be on one of the cartons.
Okay, cereal.
We got Lucky Charms, Cocoa Puffs, Frosted Flakes and Maple Loops.
I want Maple Loops.
You know who wrote that song? - Your uncle Charlie wrote that.
- No lie? If I was to lie, I'd say I wrote Stairway to Heaven, not the Maple Loops song.
- You two are really good together.
- Thank you.
So, does your wife sing, too? - No, I'm not married.
- What a shame.
Wow.
You're even better than a dog.
Dr.
Bloom? Yes, this is Alan Harper.
My wife and I need to cancel our marriage counseling appointment for this afternoon.
Yes, well, something came up.
Well, it's kind of personal.
I mean Well, yeah, I know the point of these things is I've got to go.
- Hello? - Is Charlie home? No.
I'm Charlie's brother.
Can I help you? Hi, Charlie's brother.
I'm Rose.
I'm Charlie's housekeeper.
So, you're a housekeeper? Housekeeper /actress/hand model.
I just do this to keep the wolf from the door.
You know what I mean? Sure.
Come on in.
Yeah, I can smell him.
Smell who? Your brother.
He has a very musky scent.
Well, I'll just let you get to work.
Wait.
No.
It's okay.
Jake, buddy.
Take a break.
What took you so long? We stopped for ice cream because I'm a babe magnet.
I got to take a squirt.
Why do you assume he learned that from me? Because I learned it from you.
- Hey, thanks for cleaning up.
- No, it wasn't me.
Rose was here.
Rose? You let Rose into my house? She said she was your maid.
Hell, she glued the damn cabinets shut again.
Again? You've got somebody who comes in regularly to glue your cabinets? You've met some of the whack jobs I've gone out with.
- It's not that big a stretch.
- So, this is my fault? Who let her in? You're a deeply disturbed man, you know? Move it.
Come on.
I'm deeply disturbed? Who came here in the middle of the night with his own sheets? At least, I care what I sleep on.
Or should I say, who I sleep on.
Hey, pal, of the two of us, I'll bet I'm the only one who's slept with a married woman recently.
And isn't that something to brag about? Hi, Mom.
Do you have any idea how hurtful it is to hear about your own son's divorce on the street? What divorce? What street? How did you get in my house? You stay out of this.
I'm here to help your brother through a very difficult time.
How could you do this to me? Do what? Now when I want to see my grandson I am going to have to make an appointment with Judith, who, let's face it, was never very warm to me.
And what if there's another man there? Shacking up with her? Have we even stopped to consider that? I think he's considering it now, Mom.
- Here's your iced tea, Grandma.
- Thank you, my little angel.
Darling, I asked for a lemon wedge.
All right.
Here's what you're going to do.
You and Jake will come live with me.
After all, I'm just rattling around in that big house all by myself.
That's very considerate, but as soon as Judith and I work things out, I'm going to be back at my own house.
Sweetheart, grow up.
Think about what I said.
You're my son, and I'll always have room for you in my house and in my heart.
I love you, too, Mom.
- I love you, too, Mom.
- Too little.
Too late.
- So, Vegas was good? - It was fine.
Alan, I really want to apologize for putting you through this.
I was wrong to blame you for my unhappiness.
No, no need to apologize.
What's important is that we're here and we're working on our marriage.
You look great, by the way.
Must be all the extra oxygen they pump into the casinos.
- Alan - And you were right.
I see now that the time apart did us both a lot of good.
I know I've grown.
I'm not that suffocating guy you threw out of the house four and a half days ago, let me tell you that.
Jake's doing fine.
You were concerned about him being around my brother, but Charlie's great with kids.
All right, last card, down and dirty.
King's bet.
- $1.
- I'm in.
In.
I'll see $1 and raise it $5.
You raised $5 on that? - I call.
- I call.
Queens full of nines.
Kid, don't you know what a full house is? Yeah.
And I also know what a psych-out is.
I love this boy.
And I think we're gonna look back on this as a new beginning for our marriage.
A rebirth.
A renaissance, if you will.
Alan, I think I'm gay.
All right.
We'll make a list.
On one side, we'll put gay stuff I'll see you and raise you $20.
- I think he's got you, pal.
- He's bluffing.
He always pulls his ear when he bluffs.
How about it, Mighty Mouse? You in? Take him down.
Call you.
I hate this kid.
What the hell is going on here? You said ""hell.
"" - Throw $1 in the pot.
- What? Hey, we all had to.
Charlie, may I speak with you privately, please? - Whose deal is it? - Jake, go to bed! I'm out.
What is wrong with you? Are you insane? Do you have any sense of right and wrong? Probably not.
How was dinner? How could you put Jake in a poker game with grown men? I obviously can't be trusted.
So, how was dinner? I leave you alone with him for a couple of hours I'm just gonna keep asking, Alan.
Dinner was swell.
We both had the veal piccata and she's gay! Wow.
Most chicks won't eat veal.
Why do I even try talking to you? Come on, I'm just trying to get you to lighten up a little.
I don't need to lighten up.
The world I live in is dark.
Dark and rainy.
And you're useless in it! Really? I wasn't useless when you needed a place to stay.
Obviously that was a mistake.
Are you sure? Maybe we should make a list.
Uncle Charlie? What's going on? Can't sleep? No.
My dad says we're moving to Grandma's tomorrow.
Yeah, that'd keep me up.
If it makes you feel any better, you won $80 on that last hand.
$85.
$80.
The house gets a cut.
I wish my dad was as cool as you.
Don't sell your dad short.
He loves you more than anything in the world.
You know that, don't you? I guess.
How come you don't have any kids? I don't know.
Maybe because I love me more than anything in the world.
- Uncle Charlie? - Yeah? I don't want to go to Grandma's.
I'd rather stay here.
Yeah, well, your dad knows what's best for you.
Okay.
Good night, Uncle Charlie.
I love you.
Yeah.
Okay.
You got to love a kid like that.
I even played him Stairway to Heaven and he still liked the Maple Loops song better.
Charlie, I haven't seen you in two weeks.
You finally got the house back to yourself.
Now, do you want to talk about your nephew, or do you want to have sex? Sex.
Definitely sex.
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah? Do you ever think about having kids? Whoa, we've got a good thing going.
Can't we just leave it at that? What are you doing? I thought we were gonna have sex.
How am I supposed to have sex while your biological clock is going off? Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.
Hi, Monkey Man.
I was just thinking about you and wondering why we hurt each other so much.
Rose, it's me, Monkey Man.
- Charlie? - Yeah, listen, let me ask you a question.
Is there something inherently wrong with asking a woman you're involved with if she wants kids? Charlie, we got a good thing going, why do you want to mess it up? Look at you.
All grown up and back living with Mom.
How good do you feel about yourself right now? On a scale of one to two.
I'm not back living with Mom.
I'm simply staying here till Judith and I work things out.
So, one? What do you want, Charlie? I figured you've been here a couple of weeks, you got to have blood in your stool by now.
So, I thought if you and Jake wanted to come back to my place for a while, - that'd be okay.
- Wait a minute.
Are you saying you want me to come back and live with you? Well, truthfully, no.
I want Jake to come back and live with me, but I figure you're a package deal.
Thanks, but we're doing just fine here with Mom.
Come on.
We can't let Jake be exposed to her on any kind of ongoing basis.
There's no ongoing basis.
He's only here on weekends.
That's too much.
Piranhas can strip an entire cow in an hour.
Alan, we've got to get him away from her.
I mean, look what happened to us.
And what happened to you? Hi, Mom.
Charlie, you're a grown man.
Perhaps it's time to stop blaming your mother for your own shortcomings.
Alan, the divan is not for sitting.
Charlie, get off the couch.
Uncle Charlie.
There's my good boy.
And what did I tell you about yelling in the house? Grandma, I'm suffocating.
Sound familiar? You're right, this madness must end.
Here, I got you your own key.
I am not comfortable with this.
I mean, maybe I should go wait in the car.
You're not waiting in the car.
Trust me, this is a great way to meet women.
I don't want to meet women.
I'm still married.
Come on, your wife's out meeting chicks, why shouldn't you? Your son is just adorable.
- Thank you.
- You and your life partner must be so proud.
You're right.
Go wait in the car.

27,How I Met Your Mother,"OLDER TED: Kids, I'm gonna tell you an incredible story.
The story of how I met your mother.
- Are we being punished for something? - No.
- Yeah, is this gonna take a while? - Yes.
Twenty-five years ago, before I was Dad, I had this whole other life.
It was way back in 2005.
I was 27, just starting to make it as an architect and living in New York with Marshall, my best friend from college.
My life was good.
And then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.
Will you marry me? Yes.
Perfect.
And then you're engaged, you pop the champagne, you drink a toast, you have sex on the kitchen floor.
- Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.
- Got it.
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.
Dude, are you kidding? It's you and Lily.
I've been there for all the big moments of you and Lily.
The night you met, your first date, other first things.
Yeah, sorry, we thought you were asleep.
It's physics, Marshall.
If the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves, too.
My God, you're getting engaged tonight.
Yeah.
What are you doing tonight? What was I doing? Here, Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life.
And me? I'm calling up your Uncle Barney.
Hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls? Well, now I've got a new favorite.
Lebanese girls.
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.
Hey, you wanna do something tonight? Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up! - Hey.
- Where's your suit? Just once, when I say 'suit up,' I wish you'd put on a suit.
- I did.
That one time.
- It was a blazer.
You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me.
Now it's gonna be Marshall and Lily and me.
They'll get married, start a family.
Before long, I'm that weird middle-aged bachelor their kids call 'Uncle Ted.
' I see what this is about.
Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met? Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.
- Barney.
We met at the urinal.
- Oh, right.
Hi.
Lesson one, lose the goatee.
It doesn't go with your suit.
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two, get a suit.
Suits are cool.
Exhibit A.
Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till you're 30.
Thirty.
Right, you're right.
I guess it's just, your best friend gets engaged, - you start thinking about that stuff.
- I thought I was your best friend.
Ted, say I'm your best friend.
- You're my best friend, Barney.
- Good.
Then as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game I like to call, 'Have you met Ted?' No, no, no, no, we're not playing 'Have you met Ted.
' Hi, have you met Ted? - Hi, I'm Ted.
- Yasmin.
- It's a very pretty name.
- Thanks.
It's Lebanese.
Hey.
(GROANS) I'm exhausted.
It was finger-painting day at school and a 5-year-old boy got to second base with me.
- Wow, you're cooking? - Yes, I am.
Are you sure that's a good idea after last time.
You looked really creepy without eyebrows.
I can handle this.
I think you'll find I'm full of surprises tonight.
So there's more surprises? Like what? Marshall was in his second year of law school, so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet.
Boogedy boo! And that's all of them.
I'm gonna go cook.
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.
I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.
- So do you think you'll ever get married? - Well, maybe eventually.
Some fall day.
Possibly in Central Park.
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.
Band, no DJ.
People will dance, I'm not gonna worry about it.
Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged? Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh? - Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.
One more for the lady! Oh, hey, look what I got.
Oh, honey, champagne.
Yeah.
No, you are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne.
I'm not scared.
- Then open it.
- Fine.
Please, open it.
Gosh, you are unbelievable, Marshall.
There are two big questions a man has to ask in life.
One you plan out for months, the other just slips out when you're half-drunk at some bar.
Will you marry me? You wanna go out sometime? Of course, you idiot! I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.
What's up, Carl? I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.
Did you know there's a Pop-Tart under your fridge? No, but dibs.
Where's that champagne? I wanna drink a toast with my fiancÃ©e.
I don't know why I was so scared of this.
It's pretty easy, right? (LILY SCREAMING) Why am I freaking out all of a sudden? This is crazy.
I'm not ready to settle down.
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl? The plan's always been don't even think about it until you're 30.
Exactly.
The guy doesn't even own a suit.
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.
Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was, it's like, 'Okay, I'm ready.
Where is she?' And there she was.
It was like something from an old movie where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy and says, 'See that girl? I'm gonna marry her someday.
' Hey, Barney, see that girl? Oh, yeah.
You just know she likes it dirty.
- Go say hi.
- I can't just go say hi.
I need a plan.
I'm gonna wait until she goes to the bathroom, then I'll strategically place myself by the jukebox so that Hi, have you met Ted? Hi.
Let me guess.
Ted.
I'm sorry, Lily.
I'm so sorry.
Take us to the hospital.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you hit her? Hit me? Please.
This guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun.
He's all, like, 'Oh, honey, did that hurt?' And I'm, like, 'Come on, let me have you, you pansy.
' - Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, it's okay.
Go on.
So, these spankings, are you in pajamas or au natural? - So what do you do? - I'm a reporter for Metro News 1.
- Oh.
- Well, kind of a reporter.
I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news.
You know, like, 'Monkey who can play the ukulele.
' But I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.
Bigger, like, 'Gorilla with an upright bass?' Sorry.
You're really pretty.
- Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.
- Yeah.
See, the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend.
So tonight, every guy is 'the enemy.
' You know, if it'll make your friend feel better you could throw a drink in my face.
I don't mind.
She would love that.
And it does look fun in the movies.
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night? Oh, I can't.
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.
Some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake.
- Guess who's covering it? - That's gonna take a week? Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too.
It's another record.
Hey, what's taking so long? I know this is a long shot, but how about tomorrow night? Yeah.
What the hell.
Jerk! That was fun.
De Wait for it nied.
Denied.
We're going out tomorrow night.
I thought we were playing Lazer Tag tomorrow night.
Yeah, I was never gonna go play Lazer Tag.
The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn.
Wow.
- That is one bad-ass blue French horn.
- Yeah.
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.
Son, a piece of advice.
When you go on a first date, you really don't want to say Smurf penis.
Girls don't ordinarily like that.
But this was no ordinary girl.
Lily.
How long have you been sitting there? Stupid eye patch.
Mom, Dad, I have found the future Mrs.
Ted Mosby.
Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman? Let's see.
She likes dogs? I've got five dogs.
She drinks Scotch? I love a Scotch that's old enough to order its own Scotch.
Can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters? 'Ray, when someone asks you if you're a God, you say, 'Yes!'' And I'm saving the best for last.
Do you want these? I hate olives.
- She hates olives.
Awesome! - The Olive Theory.
The Olive Theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily.
He hates olives, she loves them.
And in a weird way, that's what makes them such a great couple.
Perfect balance.
You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.
I could take them off your hands.
They're all yours.
Oh, it is on! It is on till the break of dawn.
But, wait, it's only the break of 10:30.
What happened? I gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace.
It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French.
- No green clarinet? - Nope.
Come on, no purple tuba? It's a Smurf penis or no dice.
There you are! We got a jumper.
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.
Come on, you're covering it.
All right, I'll be right there.
I'm sorry.
I had a really great time tonight.
Yeah, well.
So, did you kiss her? No, the moment wasn't right.
Look, this woman could actually be my future wife.
I want our first kiss to be amazing.
Oh, Ted, that is so sweet.
So, you chickened out like a little bitch.
What? I did not chicken out.
You know what? I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college.
Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing.
Even the dumbest single person alive.
And if you don't believe me, call him.
Hey, loser, how's not playing Lazer Tag? Because playing Lazer Tag is awesome.
Oh, I killed you, Connor.
Don't make me get your mom.
Hey, listen, I need your opinion on something.
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up! So, these guys think I chickened out.
What do you think? I can't believe you're still not wearing a suit.
She didn't even give me the signal.
What, is she gonna bat her eyes at you in Morse code? 'Ted, 'kiss me.
' - No, you just kiss her.
- Not if you don't get the signal.
- Did Marshall give me the signal? - No! I didn't, I swear.
But, see, at least tonight, I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me, never gonna happen.
You should've kissed her.
I should've kissed her.
Well, maybe in a week when she gets back from Orlando.
A week? That's like a year in hot-girl time.
She'll forget all about you.
Mark my words, you will never see that one again.
There she is.
She's cute.
Hey, Carl, turn it up.
persuaded him to reconsider.
At which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizarre story a happy ending.
Reporting from Metro 1 News, - back to you, Bill.
- The guy didn't jump.
I'm gonna go kiss her.
- Right now.
- Look, dude, it's midnight.
As your future lawyer, I'm gonna advise you that's freaking crazy.
I never do anything crazy.
I'm always waiting for the moment, planning the moment.
Well, she's leaving tomorrow and this may be the only moment I'm gonna get.
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.
I gotta take the leap.
Okay, not a perfect metaphor 'cause for me it's fall in love and get married and for him it's death.
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.
By the way, did I congratulate you two? - I'm doing this.
- Let's go.
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.
Barney? All right, but under one condition.
Look at you, you beautiful bastard, you suited up.
This is totally going in my blog.
Stop the car.
Pull over right here.
I gotta do something.
Excuse me.
Pardon me, just a sec.
- Enjoy your coffee.
- Hey! Hey! Go, go, go! Everybody brings flowers.
Okay, moment of truth.
- Wish me luck.
- Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.
'This just in.
' Okay.
- Kiss her, Ted.
Kiss her good.
- Kiss the crap out of that girl.
Marshall, remember this night.
When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're gonna tell this story.
Why does he get to be the best man? I'm your best friend! As I waIked up to that door, a million thoughts raced through my mind.
Unfortunately, one particular thought did not.
I've got five dogs.
(DOGS BARKING) Not good, not good.
- No! - Get back in there.
You're wearing a suit! ROBIN: Ted? Hi.
I was just Come on up.
MARSHALL: He's in.
So, Ranjit, you must have done it with a Lebanese girl? Okay, that's my Barney limit.
I'm gonna see if that bodega has a bathroom.
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.
- The women hot there? - Here's a picture of my wife.
(WHISPERING) A simple 'no' would have sufficed.
She's lovely.
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at 1:00 in the morning in a suit? I was just hoping to get those olives that you said I could have.
Would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth? Are you trying to get me drunk? For starters.
(MUSIC PLAYING) Thank you.
So, Marshall, this Olive Theory based on you and Lily.
- Yeah.
- You hate olives.
- Lily loves them, you can't stand them.
- Yeah, I hate olives.
Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street.
Dish of olives.
You had some.
What up? You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.
- I swear.
- I swear.
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.
Lily asked if she could have my olives.
I said, 'Sure, I hate olives.
' But you like olives.
Well, I was 18, okay? I was a virgin.
Been waiting my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.
Marshall, I'm gonna give you an early wedding present.
Don't get married.
I think I like your Olive Theory.
I think I like your new French horn.
I think I like your nose.
I think I'm in love with you.
What? What? What? Come on, man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is? Hunger.
You're hungry for experience.
Hungry for something new.
Hungry for olives.
But you're too scared to do anything about it.
Yeah, I'm scared, okay? But when I think of spending the rest of my life with Lily, committing forever, no other women, doesn't scare me at all.
I'm marrying that girl.
Lily.
Lily, I like olives.
We'll make it work.
(SIGHING) So, Orlando? You gonna hit Disney World? - You love me? - Oh, God.
I can't believe I said that.
Why did I say that? Who says that? - I should just go.
- Hold on.
Wait a minute.
I promised you these.
- Olives.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
I love you.
What is wrong with me? Why are we still sitting here? Let's go.
We can still make last call.
What do you say, Lil? 'Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum'? - 'Cause you're a pirate? - Okay, eye patch gone.
And we can't just abandon Ted.
If it doesn't go well up there, he's gonna need some support.
It's been, like, 20 minutes.
Do you think they're doing it? You think they're doing it in front of the dogs? Doggie style.
I knew this girl in college, she had this Golden Retriever Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop taIking.
Hit it, Ranjit.
So, when you tell this story to your friends, could you avoid the word 'psycho'? I'd prefer 'eccentric.
' Goodnight, psycho.
Great.
- How do I get to the F train? - Oh.
- Two blocks, that way and take a right.
- Thanks.
You know what? I'm done being single.
I'm not good at it.
Look, obviously, you can't tell a woman you just met you love her, but it sucks that you can't.
I'll tell you something, though.
If a woman, not you, just some hypothetical woman, were to bear with me through all this, I think I'd make a damn good husband because that's the stuff I'd be good at.
Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father and waIking her five hypothetical dogs.
Being a good kisser.
- Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.
- Oh, I've got references.
Goodnight, Ted.
- And I'm a good handshaker.
- That's a pretty great handshake.
And that was it.
I'll probably never see her again.
- What? - That was the signal.
That long, lingering handshake.
You should've kissed her.
There's no such thing as the signal.
But, yeah, that was the signal.
Signal.
Carl, thank you.
There's something I gotta do.
By the way, you should've kissed her.
Carl, you guys weren't there.
I am so turned on right now.
Guys, trust me.
I've seen the signal.
- That was not the signal.
- Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.
- To my fiancÃ©e.
- To the future.
To one hell of a night.
That was not the signal.
I asked her about it years later, and, yeah, that was the signal.
I could've kissed her.
But that's the funny thing about destiny, it happens whether you plan it or not.
I mean, I never thought I'd see that girl again.
But it turns out, I was just too close to the puzzle to see the picture that was forming.
Because that, kids, is the true story of how I met your Aunt Robin.
Aunt Robin? I thought this was how you met Mom.
Will you relax? I'm getting to it.
Like I said, it's a long story.",success

So, Malcolm, why is playing a problem? First off I don't even know Stevie.
His mother said you boys ate lunch together.
One time.
He rolled his wheelchair over next to me.
It's not like I could say, ''Go away.
'' He's not even in my class.
He's in the Krelboyne class in the trailer next to tetherball.
You listen to me, young man.
That one lunch obviously meant a lot to Stevie.
He's a human being with human feelings.

It's your turn to walk with him.
I walked him yesterday and the day before.
I walked with him when he wet his pants.

Mom said to hold hands.
She did not say to hold hands, Dewey.
I'm not holding hands.

She said he's in jail.
He's not in jail.
He's at Marlin Academy.
It's, like, one of the best private schools in the country and it's totally unfair.
Everyone acts like Francis is just this big troublemaker and he's not.
Dad, I know what you're going to say and believe me, I totally agree with you.
There is no excuse for what I did.
It was idiotic, immature, totally reckless and I'm really sorry.
I'm just I'm hoping against hope that you will give me another chance, which, I admit I don't deserve but if you could just find it in your heart to forgive me I know I could earn your trust back.

Damn! You boys, you keep this house clean till your dad comes home.
Two of you can have slices of pizza for lunch.
The other one can have I don't know.
I think they're peas.
( Phone Rings ) Somebody get that.
- Not it.
- Not it.
Hello.
Young Master Malcolm.
Francis, hi.
Hey, man I wrote you guys a really long letter yesterday but, listen, they only gave me, like, three minutes so would you put the special prosecutor on? Mom, it's Francis.
Hey, Francis, how's school? Oh, couldn't be better, Mom.
My new roommate showed me how to kill mice with a hammer yesterday, so, you know, between that and the general atmosphere of simmering homoeroticism I think I'm really starting to turn around.
Honey, it's only until summer.
Come on, push it! Give it up, prom date.
Yeah, listen, um I know I shouldn't ask but would you be able to send me my allowance like, a couple of weeks early 'cause I kind of need some? Oh, my God! Are you smoking? What? You're smoking.
I can hear you smoking.
You're smoking, aren't you? Mom, I'm not smoking.
Geez.
After seeing the anguish your father and I went through to quit didn't any of that register with you? Okay, listen.
I'll talk to your dad.
Maybe we can send you part of it.
Honey, I have to go.
I'm late for work.
I'll call you later.
Okay, thanks, Mom.
I love you.
( Dial Tone ) Oh I love you.
He's so lucky.
I know.
We never go anywhere.
He gets to be in Alabama.
Is Alabama nice? Look it up, Dewey.
It's got Sequoia Caverns the biggest cast-iron statue in the world.
Plus it's right next to Florida where Disney World is.
I bet he goes to Disney World all the time.
Hey, moron, he's 1 6.
He doesn't do kid stuff.
He goes to parties, drinks beer and goes skiing.
Right, genius.
They do lots of skiing in Alabama.
- Shut up! - You shut up! - No, you shut up! - Make me! I'll make you right-- ( Screaming ) Not my face! You'd better not be fighting in there, Reese, Malcolm! I said, you better not be fighting-- ( Doorbell Ringing ) For crying out loud! Reese! Malcolm! ( Doorbell Ringing ) Yes.
Can I help you? Oh.
My good um, hi.
Hel hello.
I'm.
Are you? I'm Caroline Miller from Malcolm's school.
I sent you some letters and left some messages on your answering machine.
Okay, fine.
You caught me.
What do you want? Um well, it's been three weeks and you haven't responded and it's really important I mean, well, for Malcolm's sake that the parents be as involved in So you're here to insult my parenting skills? No.
I'm sure you're a terrific parent.
( Screaming ) Who's the baby now? I'm here because I think that there is a tremendous opportunity for Could you, you know, maybe put a top on? They're just boobs, lady.
You see them in the mirror every morning.
I'm sure yours are a lot nicer than mine.
That's actually not Let me tell you something else.
The reason I didn't respond is because it is a load of crap.
What? You are not going to stick my Malcolm in some special ed class.
What is it with you people? Why do you have to label everybody? Malcolm may be a little strange and, I know, I know, he never shuts up but he is not disturbed.
You know, he is a good boy Please! You know what? You don't understand at all, okay? So if I could just come in for a minute I could explain everything, okay? Reese: Ow! Ow! Ow! Good, hon.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's something we have to talk about.
I thought we weren't going to mention that until after the biopsy.
It's not that.
It's about Malcolm.
I didn't do it.
He did it.
I saw him.
A teacher from school came by and she ran some tests with Malcolm.
He has an IQ of 1 65.
Who? Malcolm.
He's a genius.
He's going to a special class.
What? Malcolm's special? Where do you think that came from? They have a special program for gifted children.
They have advanced textbooks and devoted teachers and good things they don't want to waste on normal kids.
You start on Monday.
In the Krelboyne class? Mom, no.
I don't want to.
What are you talking about? Of course you want to.
No.
I want to stay in my own class.
I don't want to be a Krelboyne.
Mom, seriously, Krelboynes get their butts kicked.
Just stop one minute.
There's nothing wrong with being smart.
And there's nothing wrong with being cut from the herd.
It makes you the one buffalo that isn't there when the Indians run the rest - of them off the cliff.
- Huh? Mom, this isn't fair.
If I don't want to go, why do I have to? Because it's not just up to you.
We have to do what's best for you.
Is Malcolm going to Alabama? Mom, please! Don't make me go! Please! Malcolm, calm down.
But it isn't fair! That's right.
It isn't fair.
It's the first time anyone in this family has ever been given an edge and you are not going to waste it.
Dad? Honey? Well look, honey Malcolm, you see Oh, for crying out loud.
How come there's never any iced tea in this pitcher? I make a fresh batch every morning and it's gone by the time I get home.
I want a better family! Malcolm Go get yogurt.
Look at that.
Gone.
Can't you make iced tea? No! I don't want to go to a special class.
People think I'm weird enough already.
I know.
I like where I am.
I want to stay.
That's because you don't understand the world yet.
Sweetie, life does not give you a lot of chances to move up even if you deserve it.
Look at your dad and me.
Malcolm, I'm proud of you.
You boys are so lucky.
You have so many gifts that other kids don't have.
And I don't just mean Stevie Kenarban, either.
I mean, look at those Parker boys across the street.
They may be healthy, but honest to God those are the ugliest little boys ever born.
They look like boiled beets, don't you think? And those Henderson kids? That electrocuted their dog when they were trying to get free cable.
How smart can they be? And your friend Richard.
He's not ugly or dumb.
Yes, but he's very effeminate.
Just remember any kid who makes fun of you is a creepy little loser who'll end up working in a car wash.
This shouldn't make me feel better, but it does.
You'll be all right, sweetie.
If you don't make a big deal out of this nobody else will either.
And I just can't say enough about how proud we should all be of Malcolm for getting into the gifted program.
Now Malcolm may not look different than the rest of us but he is.
Very different.
In his brain.
And I think we should recognize him for that.
Bye.
Caroline: All righty, today we are starting a new section on the Peloponnesian War which I know you are all going to love.
Malcolm? Are you okay? Uh, yeah.
Fine.
All right.
Excuse me.
Stop staring at me! Why do they keep doing that? You're new.
Oh, great.
So I'm the freak of the freak show? Pi to 50 places.
Mark.
Set.
Go.
Turn around, or I swear to God I'll kill you.
Just chill out.
Don't tell me to chill out.
You chill out.
Nobody can live like this.
- I'm okay.
- Oh, sure.
You're okay because it doesn't make any difference to you.
You've always been a freak.
I used to be normal.
Wait.
Who just said that? You're going to take that the wrong way aren't you? You suck.
It's so cool! Around here, being smart is exactly like being radioactive.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Stevie? What? Look I Score! ( Laughing ) Hey, Spath! Why don't you stop being such a buttwipe?! All: Ooh.
What'd you call me? You heard me! I don't care anymore! I just don't care, Spath, okay? Alls you ever do is make everybody miserable! Except for your little monkey-slaves over there.
Who, by the way, only pretend to like you.
They hate you as much as everyone else does! And you're just too busy being mean and stupid to ever figure it out! I keep trying to run, but my legs won't work.
Mom was right: They are important.
Wow.
I don't know about you but the Krelboyne really hurt my feelings.
( Nervous Laughter ) Hey Go away, Stevie.
It's good you two are friends.
He won't mind sharing his wheelchair.
Okay, this is where something good happens, finally.
So we're going to slow down and make it last as long as possible.
( All Gasping ) Dude, you hit a cripple.
( Gasping And Shouting ) I didn't mean to I wasn't trying Stevie, I'm sorry.
( Stevie Groaning ) Ow aah ow! What's your problem? I mean, he's in a wheelchair and he has glasses.
So then, the principal comes out and everyone's all talking at once.
So the story he puts together is that Spath attacks Stevie for his lunch and I'm like this hero that stepped in to defend him.
It was beautiful.
Okay, it wasn't funny when Spath started crying.
No, wait, it was.
Dad's hair ugh.
Yeah, I know.
It's gross.
But, hey, if a bunch of birds can make the best out of what they get then so can I.
Dewey: Malcolm? Like having to go to special class.
I can make it work out, right? Malcolm? Not now! Or my family.
We're not the greatest family in the world but we can get better.
I mean, it's not impossible.
Malcolm? What?! Can I get out? No, stop asking.
So basically, I think everything's going to be okay.
( Pounding ) A bug went up my nose.
So what do you want me to do about it?",success
29,The Good Place,"1 [light chime music.]
[sighs.]
[door clicks open.]
Eleanor? Come on in.
Hi, Eleanor.
I'm Michael.
How are you today? I'm great.
Thanks for asking.
Oh, one question.
Where am I? Who are you? And what's going on? Right, so, you, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Your life on Earth has ended, and you are now in the next phase of your existence in the universe.
Cool.
Cool.
I have some questions.
Thought you might.
[chuckles.]
How did I die? I-I don't remember.
Yes, um, in cases of traumatic or embarrassing deaths, we erase the memory to allow for a peaceful transition.
Are you sure you want to hear? All right, so you were in a grocery store parking lot.
You dropped a bottle of something called ""Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One.
"" And when you bent down to pick it up, a long column of shopping carts that were being returned to the shopping cart collection area rolled out of control and plowed right into you.
Oof.
That's how I died? No, sorry, there's more.
You were able to grab on to the front of the column of shopping carts, but it swept you right out into the street where you were struck and killed by a mobile billboard truck advertising an erectile dysfunction pill called ""Engorge-ulate.
"" Funnily enough, the first EMT to arrive was an ex-boyfriend of yours Okay, that's I get it, thank you.
Oh, okay, sorry.
Um, so who was right? I mean about all of this? Well, let's see.
Hindus are a little bit right, Muslims a little bit.
Jews, Christians, Buddhists, every religion guessed about 5%, except for Doug Forcett.
Who who's Doug Forcett? Well, Doug was a stoner kid who lived in Calgary during the 1970s.
One night, he got really high on mushrooms, and his best friend, Randy, said, ""Hey, what do you think happens after we die?"" And Doug just launched into this long monologue where he got like 92% correct.
[chuckles.]
I mean, we couldn't believe what we were hearing.
That's him, actually, right up there.
He's pretty famous around here.
I'm very lucky to have that.
- So - [chuckles.]
Maybe my biggest question: am I I mean, is this Or Well, it's not the heaven or hell idea that you were raised on.
But generally speaking, in the afterlife, there's a Good Place and there's a Bad Place.
You're in the Good Place.
- [exhales sharply.]
- You're okay, Eleanor.
You're in the Good Place.
Well, that's good.
Sure is.
[laughs.]
Okay, let's take a walk, shall we? Oh, did I have a purse? No, I'm dead, right.
Okay.
So this is how it works.
The Good Place is divided into distinct neighborhoods.
Each one contains exactly 322 people who have been perfectly selected to blend together into a blissful harmonic balance.
Do all the neighborhoods look like this? No, every neighborhood is unique.
Some have warm weather, some cold.
Some are cities, some farmland.
But in each one, every blade of grass, every ladybug, every detail has been precisely designed and calibrated for its residents.
There's a lot of frozen yogurt places.
Yeah.
[sighs.]
That's the one thing we put in all the neighborhoods.
People love frozen yogurt.
I don't know what to tell you.
You're gonna have a million more questions, I know.
For right now, better grab a seat.
Movie's about to begin.
[indistinct chatter.]
- Ah.
[chuckles.]
Hello, everyone.
- And welcome to your first day in the afterlife.
You were all, simply put, good people.
But how do we know that you were good? How are we sure? - During your time on Earth, - every one of your actions had a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe.
- Every sandwich you ate, - - every time you bought a magazine, - every single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad.
You know how some people pull into the breakdown lane when there's traffic? And they think to themselves, ""Ah, who cares? No one's watching.
"" We were watching.
Surprise.
[laughter.]
Anyway, when your time on Earth has ended, we calculate the total value of your life using our perfectly accurate measuring system.
Only the people with the very highest scores, the true cream of the crop, get to come here, to the Good Place.
What happens to everyone else, you ask? Don't worry about it.
The point is, you are here because you lived one of the very best lives that could be lived.
And you won't be alone.
Your true soul mate is here too.
- [crowd gasps and murmurs.]
- That's right.
Soul mates are real.
One of the other people in your neighborhood is your actual soul mate, and you will spend eternity together.
So welcome to eternal happiness.
Welcome to the Good Place.
Sponsored by: otters holding hands while they sleep.
You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands? That's how you're gonna feel every day.
[applause.]
So who is in the Bad Place, that would shock me? Uh, well, Mozart, Picasso, Elvis, basically every artist ever, uh, every U.
S.
president except Lincoln.
That sounds about right.
What about Florence Nightingale? That was close, but, no, she didn't make it.
Wow, all those amazing people down there, it just seems so hard to believe.
Again, it's an incredibly selective system.
Most people don't make it here.
But you, a lawyer who got innocent people off death row, you're special, Eleanor.
And by the way, welcome to your new home.
Oh, it's perfect, isn't it? You see, in the Good Place, every person gets to live in a home that perfectly matches his or her true essence.
Cool.
So I guess that's why my house, for example, is this adorable little cottage, whereas other people might have homes that are bigger, like that one.
Exactly.
Oh, I'm so happy you get it.
As you can see, the interior has been decorated just as you like it, in the Icelandic primitive style.
Oh, oh, and, uh, of course, you love clowns, so I do love clowns.
Now, let me show you the, uh the video system here.
[shimmering tone.]
You can review everything that happened in your life from your point of view.
There we go.
This is your Human Rights mission to the Ukraine.
I mean, you got a ton of points for that one.
It really put you over the top.
Oh.
Chidi, come on in.
Eleanor? I'm Chidi Anagonye, and you are my soul mate.
Cool, bring it in, man.
Now, excuse me.
I have other people to attend to.
So where you from, Chidi? Well, I was born in Nigeria, raised in Senegal, but my work took me all over the place Australia, Hong Kong, Paris.
What about you? Uh, well, I I was born in Phoenix.
- Mm-hmm.
- Arizona.
And then I went to school in Tempe, Arizona.
And then I moved back to Phoenix, Arizona.
Your English is amazing.
Oh! I'm actually speaking French.
This place just translates whatever you say into a language the other person can understand.
- So it's incredible.
- Whoa.
And now I want to say this.
Mm-kay.
Eleanor.
I have spent my entire life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the universe.
And now we can actually learn about them together as soul mates.
It's overwhelming.
Chidi.
You'll stand by my side no matter what, right? Of course I will.
Promise me.
Say, ""I promise I will never betray you for any reason.
"" Eleanor, I swear that I will never say or do anything to cause you any harm.
Good.
Because those aren't my memories.
I wasn't a lawyer.
I never went to the Ukraine.
I hate clowns.
There's been a big mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
Wait, what? [light instrumental music.]
[children chattering.]
Are you sure this isn't you? Yeah, man, I'm pretty sure I wasn't a death row lawyer who collected clown paintings and rescued orphans.
They got my name right, but nothing else.
I mean, somebody royally forked up.
Somebody forked up.
Why can't I say ""fork""? If you're trying to curse, you can't here.
I guess a lot of people in this neighborhood don't like it, so it's prohibited.
That's bullshirt.
So, uh, if you're not this person, then who are you? What did you do for a living? I was in sales.
So we sell two products here, NasaPRO and NasaPRO Silver.
We aim this at seniors.
Now, you can't legally call it medicine because it doesn't technically work and it is technically chalk, so what you're gonna want to do You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake medicine.
I get it, man.
Which one's my desk? So your job was to defraud the elderly? Sorry the sick and elderly? But I was very good at it.
I was the top salesperson five years running.
Okay, but that's worse.
I mean, you you do get how that's worse? - Right? - Mm.
[indistinct chatter.]
You know, maybe it's a test.
Maybe if you go to Michael and you tell him the truth, you'll pass the test and you'll get to stay.
No way.
I can't risk going to the Bad Place.
Okay, well, maybe it's not actually, like, all that bad.
Let's just get some information first.
We'll ask Janet.
Hey, Janet? - Hi there.
- Gah! How can I help you? What the fork? Who are you? I'm Janet.
I'm the informational assistant here in the Good Place.
She's like this walking database.
You can ask her about the creation of the universe or history Oh, there was a guy who lived in Avondale, Arizona, around 2002.
His name was Kevin Paltonic.
- Is he gay? - No.
Really? Huh.
I guess he just didn't want to have sex with me.
That's correct.
Well, that's fine, I wasn't that into him anyway.
- Yes, you were.
- Okay, Janet, - I have a question.
- Okay.
What is the Bad Place like? Oh, sorry, that is the one topic I'm not allowed to tell you about.
I can only play you a brief audio clip of what is happening there right now.
Okay.
[people yelling and screaming, mechanical buzzing.]
- The bear has two mouths! - [people screaming.]
[sound stops.]
Well, it doesn't sound awesome.
[scoffs.]
Does everyone have a huge house except me? All right, we need a plan.
I say we just lie low and hope that they don't notice me.
I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you.
I just don't like being dishonest, and I can't advise you to be dishonest either.
Come on, I'm just asking you to fudge a little bit.
You must've told a few white lies in your life.
I mean, what was your job? I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.
Motherforker! I'm getting a stomachache.
I'm in a perfect utopia, and I'm I have a stomachache.
This is awful.
I-I, uh I think I have to tell Michael about this.
Tell Michael about what? Michael? Hi.
What have you been up to? Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet Tahani and Jianyu.
They are soul mates and your next-door neighbors.
Hello.
Can I just say I love your house? It's just so tiny and cute.
It's like a little child's plaything, like for a family of mice or for a very fancy little dog.
I love it.
It's just so sweet and teensy.
Just like you.
Boop.
- Oh.
- Oh.
You booped me.
Ha-ha.
- I did.
- That's fun.
Tahani and Jianyu are having a little welcome party tonight, and they've invited the entire neighborhood.
- [squeaks.]
- I simply adore entertaining.
Don't I just adore it, Jianyu? Oh, um, yes, by the way, Jianyu here is a Buddhist monk, you see? And he obeys a strict code of silence.
So when you see him smiling and nodding, that's actually his way of jumping up and down with glee.
Isn't that right, darling? So we'll see you tonight? - Great.
- Yes.
[indistinct chatter.]
- [scoffs.]
- No way.
[indistinct chatter.]
My entire house could fit in this room.
Okay, uh help me out here.
Tell me one good thing that you did on Earth, just one truly kind and decent act so that I can feel better about helping you out.
Let's forget about good.
Um, just tell me something neutral about yourself.
Like, tell me about the day before you died.
What do you remember? Hi there.
Do you have a second to talk about the environment? Do you have a second to eat my farts? You missed.
[scoffs.]
Pick it up if you're so horny for the environment.
I don't remember anything specific.
- Oh.
- Look.
I might not have been a saint, but it's not like I killed anybody.
I wasn't an arsonist.
I never found a wallet outside of an IHOP and thought about returning it but saw the owner lived out of state so just took the cash and dropped the wallet back on the ground.
Okay, that's really specific, and that makes me think that you definitely did do that.
All I'm saying is these people might be ""good,"" but are they really that much better than me? Well, I spent half my life in North Korea fighting for women's rights and the other half in Saudi Arabia fighting for gay rights.
So we said, ""If the U.
N.
won't remove those land mines, we will.
"" And we dug up over a thousand unexploded land mines from the area surrounding the orphanage.
Well, then he said, ""You can't give me both your kidneys; you'll die.
"" And I said, ""But you will live.
"" And I know we just met on this bus ten minutes ago, but he seemed nice.
[groans.]
Oh, forget it.
Heading to the bar! [glass clinking.]
[polite applause.]
Thank you, thank you.
You all know that I am the architect of this neighborhood.
But what you don't know is Golly, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but, um, oh, what the heck? This is actually the very first neighborhood that I have ever designed.
I had been an apprentice for over 200 years, and my boss has finally given me my first solo project.
- [murmurs and applause.]
- Yes! [laughs.]
Ah, gah-gah gah-gah-gah.
Hold on there, ace.
Let me get more of them shrampies.
- Okay, easy.
- What? They're for everybody, right? Yes, exactly.
And you deserve a perfect world because every single one of you is a good person.
That's it for me.
Back to you, Tahani.
- Bravo, Michael, bravo! - Thank you.
Um, and I would just like to quickly say if any of you would like to play tennis tonight, we have 36 regulation grass tennis courts.
Such fun.
Cheers.
[laughs.]
[applause.]
Tahani, what a condescending bench.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Am I right? Why does she still have that British accent, right? No one else here has an accent.
She's choosing to have that accent.
- Shh-shh-shh-shh.
- [stodgily.]
""Oh, hello.
""I am just a big, beautiful, utterly perfect cartoon giraffe.
"" Oh, okay.
Okay.
- I think it's time to go home.
- [laughing mockingly.]
Wait, wait, wait.
I just have to go upstairs real quick and steal a bunch of gold stuff.
Okay, don't do that.
Don't do no, Eleanor, Eleanor, Eleanor.
[light instrumental music.]
Hello, creepy house that I hate.
Hello, one million clowns.
Why aren't there stairs here? [groans.]
What kind of weirdo house is this? Ooh.
Did you fill your bra with shrimp? No.
[hiccups.]
Yes.
Whatever, it's freakin' heaven.
I'm sure they have plenty of shellfish.
That Tahani is a real butthead, huh? [gasps.]
Hey.
At least I can still say ""butthead.
"" [groans.]
She is a butthead.
Found some pajamas.
Chidi Chidi, Chidi? I'm sorry that you had to deal with this It's okay.
It's not, though.
[sighs.]
Do you think anybody cared that I died? Maybe someone did.
I don't know.
I was an only child.
My parents were divorced when I was a kid.
They were both crummy people, so they're probably [imitates fart.]
in the Bad Place.
Maybe they're being used to torture each other.
It would work.
[chuckles.]
I bet way more people cared that you died.
'Cause you're a nice person.
[clears throat.]
You're a nice person, Chidi Anaconda.
Anagonye.
Aganocomonga.
Anagonye.
- Ags say it again.
- Anagonye.
No, say what you said before.
I did.
It's Anagonye.
You just changed it.
I didn't change it; it's my name.
Argrugande.
Ariana Grande.
[gasps.]
That's a person.
I did it.
Good night.
Good night.
[button clicks.]
[playful music.]
[people cheer.]
[playful musical flourish.]
Well, that's terrifying.
[snoring.]
[thunder crashes, birds cawing.]
[thunder crashing.]
That can't be good.
[pop music.]
I'm stronger than I've been before This is the part When I break free 'Cause I can't resist it no more Oh, fork.
The part when I say I don't want ya I'm stronger than I've been before This is the part When I break free 'Cause I can't resist it no more - Michael.
- Mm? Is that giant, terrifying ladybug supposed to be there? Ah, well, great question, Tahani.
No.
No, it's not.
I have no idea why any of this is happening or how to control it.
Should we run away then? Yes.
It was lethal - Righto.
- It was fatal In my dreams, it just felt so right But I woke up every time Ooh, baby This is the part When I say I don't want ya I'm stronger than I've been before Chidi, Chidi! What's going on? Why are there giant animals everywhere? Do you hear Ariana Grande playing? Why is everyone wearing blue and yellow? You're not.
You're you're the only one who's not.
Eleanor, this is all happening because of you.
Ah, fork me.
Okay, okay.
We don't know this is because of me.
Eleanor, this place is a perfectly made Swiss watch, and you are a wrench in the gears.
Actually, you're a hammer, just smashing the gears into dust.
Oh, hang on.
Not everybody here is perfect, okay? Tahani is totally condescending.
And there are a couple of, you know, chunksters.
Oh, come on! No judgment.
I'm just saying I'm not the only one with flaws.
So how can we be sure this is my fault? You hogged all the shrimp, and now there are shrimp flying around.
You called Tahani a giraffe, and now there are giraffes everywhere.
Okay, fine, turns out there are many ways to know that it was me.
Let's just face it, Eleanor, you don't belong here.
Well, then this system sucks.
What, one in a million gets to live in paradise and everyone else is tortured for eternity? Come on.
I mean, I wasn't freaking Gandhi, but I was okay.
I was a medium person.
I should get to spend eternity in a medium place! Like Cincinnati.
Everyone who wasn't perfect but wasn't terrible should get to spend eternity in Cincinnati.
Look, apparently it doesn't work that way.
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but there's nothing anyone can do.
Unless there is something we can do.
Unless you could teach me.
Teach you what? How to be good.
That was your job, right? A professor of ethics? No one knew I was a problem when I arrived.
Things only started getting crazy after I was an ash-hole to everyone at the party.
[groans.]
You know I'm trying to say ""ash-hole"" and not ""ash-hole,"" right? I got that, yes.
Okay, give me a chance.
Let me earn my place here.
Let me be your ethical guinea pig.
[knock at door.]
Hey, guys! Uh, emergency neighborhood meeting, now! We'll be right there, Michael! If I walk out of here in these clothes, I'm toast.
My soul is in your hands, soul mate.
What's it gonna be? [knock at door.]
[thunder crashes.]
Oh, stomachache.
[mid-tempo music.]
I, uh I don't know what to do here.
This is a mess, morally speaking.
This is a putrid, disgusting bowl of ethical soup.
Okay, well how about we just chill and go to the town meeting and talk it out after? - W - Great.
Hey, how do I make that helper woman show up? Hello? Front desk lady? Magical slave robot? Excuse me, Janet? - Hi there.
- [gasps.]
Gah still not used to it.
Um, Janet, I need quick question: can anyone access our search history, or is this an incognito browsing situation like when you're stalking a hot male man from your work computer? It is 100% confidential.
No one can access what you ask me, including Michael.
Now, what kind of pornography would you like to see? No.
No, no, no, not porn.
I, um I need clothes like yours and Chidi's with the stripes.
There you go.
[indistinct chatter.]
[claps.]
Everybody, everybody! Uh, gather round, please, thank you, thank you.
Obviously, there's something very wrong with this neighborhood.
We don't know what it is, how long it will last, or what caused it.
What do we know, Janet? We know where it happened.
Here.
Yes, thank you, Janet.
The chaos happened here.
See, that's the trouble with these perfect systems.
One little flaw can lead to well, it can lead to Gary over there.
[indistinct murmuring.]
Hey, Gary.
Hang in there, buddy.
Boy, my armpits are leaking.
What is that called again? - Sweat.
- Right, right.
Still not used to being in a human body.
And what do you do with sweat? Do do you lick it away, is that right? No, you dab it with a cloth.
Oh, right.
And then you lick the cloth? That seems weirder.
Michael.
Look! Okay.
That's a good sign.
It it could mean that this is almost over.
Oh, such a relief.
That was my first time as a fashion ""don't,"" and I did not care for it.
Okay, I think it is time to make me good, partner.
How do we do it? Is there a pill I can take or something I could vape? Where did you get a chalkboard? It's the Good Place; you can get anything you want at any time.
And you chose a chalkboard? What are you reading? ""The Metaphysics of Morals"" by Immanuel Kant.
It's a treatise on the aesthetic preconditions of the mind's receptivity to duty.
A book on how to act good.
Oh, great! So you've decided to help me? I don't know.
There's a thousand questions.
Is there a moral imperative to help you? Do I have a greater obligation to my community? Are you taking someone else's spot, someone who deserves to be here? Ooh, on that question, I honestly think I was just put here by mistake.
Because Michael called me Eleanor Shellstrop, so he knows I'm me.
He's just wrong about my overall ""quality"" level.
Please, help me, man.
I swear I am worth it.
Tell me one fact that you know about me.
I mean, we spent the whole day together.
You must remember something.
What country am I from? [groans.]
Is it racist if I say Africa? Yes, and Africa is not a country.
I am from Senegal.
Do I have any siblings? Where did I go to college? Trick question.
You didn't.
I was literally a college professor.
Do you not remember one single thing about me? Dude, things have been nuts around here.
I bet you don't know anything about me.
You were born in Phoenix.
You went to school in Tempe.
You're an only child.
Your favorite show is something called ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"" and your favorite book is Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.
How did you know all that? Because you are constantly talking about yourself.
You are the most self-obsessed person I have ever met.
You should see Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.
Okay, this is my fear about you, Eleanor.
You are too selfish to ever be a good person.
Well, I think you're wrong.
What country am I from, again? Sen sodyne.
That is a brand of toothpaste.
Look, the only thing that you are concerned with is your own happiness.
That's your problem.
[scoffs.]
Okay, names in the hat.
Time to pick a designated driver.
And the loser is Betsy.
Wait, you never get picked, and you're always the one who draws the name.
- Let me see that.
- There's no need.
Everyone here believes in my integrity 100%, right, guys? Give it to me.
For the record, I did that out of principle, because it absolutely had your name on it.
If I check the other ones, I can figure it out by process of elimination.
[indistinct chatter.]
All right, everyone, let's get started.
Things have settled down.
Whew! [chuckles.]
So hopefully, we're off and running.
Welcome to orientation, day two.
Now, today we're gonna start with something that everyone has always wanted to do.
Flying.
[gasps and warm applause.]
Now that you're dead, let's live a little, right? Uh, sorry.
Uh, Michael? If if I might? I was just thinking, earlier today in all of the chaos, large swaths of this neighborhood were destroyed.
We thought perhaps some of us could, uh, volunteer to help clean up the debris.
You know, it's quite a fun way to band together as a community, isn't that right, Jianyu? Oh, uh, yeah, sorry.
For those of you who don't know, my soul mate, Jianyu here, is a Buddhist monk.
He took a vow of silence that he's still observing, even here, in the Good Place.
It's truly inspiring.
Well, Tahani, it's not really your job to clean up, but I suppose there's no harm if you really want to.
Oh, well, hurrah.
We need about, uh, 12 volunteers.
Oh! I can't believe all these people are passing on flying to pick up garbage all day.
[chuckles.]
Have fun, nerds.
I'll be soaring through the air like a forkin' bird.
Eleanor and I would love to help.
Ah, hurrah-hurrah, yay.
Dude.
You want to prove you're not selfish? Here's the perfect test.
There's something fun that you want to do, and then there's something less fun that people are doing for the common good.
Which do you choose? Have fun.
Whoo! [woman laughing.]
- Hey! - [people chattering.]
Yeah! Whee! Hey, up there, having fun, or does it maybe suck, probably? I'd say it's like 50 million simultaneous orgasms, but better.
How's volunteer garbage pickup? - About the same.
- Great! Whee! You know, this really reminds me of my time in Vietnam, picking up mortar shells with my godmother, Diana.
Doesn't really matter of what she's a princess of.
It's not really important.
Tahani! How goes the cleaning? Oh, swimmingly, Michael.
And I have to say this neighborhood that you've built is truly a masterpiece, the likes of which I've never seen.
And I've been to Johnny Depp's private bird sanctuary.
Well, thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.
[sniffs.]
But it's also dead wrong.
This neighborhood is a disaster.
See, I must have made a mistake somewhere.
[sniffs.]
And it led to all this chaos, and now I'm just I'm just terrified that it's gonna happen again.
I'm trying to put a good face on well, this this face that I've constructed for myself.
But the truth is, I I'm just miserable.
[sniffs.]
I have to go.
Thank you so much for your service.
Oh, no.
Powerful people do not handle failure well.
Michael could be heading for a total meltdown.
Soul mate, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Should we say it at the same time? All right.
One, two, three.
We must help Michael.
Oh, you sly devil.
You're going to keep me on my toes, aren't you? All right, come on.
Let's go.
[giggling.]
- Oh.
- Ooh.
Hey, Gunnar! Hey, Antonio! Hey, Eleanor.
- Isn't this great? - Um, yeah.
When I thought of the afterlife, I totally pictured being an unpaid, non-flying janitor.
Us too! [laughter.]
You guys are so fun.
Just relentlessly fun.
I keep thinking, ""When are they gonna stop being fun?"" And the answer is never.
- You're never gonna stop.
- [both giggling.]
Well, I have had a pretty full day of being unselfish.
I've made some new friends.
My area's almost garbage-free.
So you're gonna help me figure out how to stay, right? Well, that is a really tough question.
Most great philosophers would say helping you is pointless, that you can't try to be good, especially when your motivations are so obviously corrupt.
Yeah, but what do most great philosophers know? On the other hand, Aristotle thought that moral virtue is something that you could get better at.
He he compared it to playing the flute.
The more you practice, the more you improve.
Aristotle! That's my boy, right there.
He was the best.
I mean, most people agree he was the best one.
So it sounds to me like you are on board the ""help Eleanor"" train.
Well, I've narrowed it down to two possibilities: yes and no.
Well, no worries.
Just hit me up when you're done weighing my life in your hands.
I'll just keep doing what I do best: being super considerate and selfless.
[exhales.]
Hey, guys.
Okay, Eleanor, reminder.
We switched to a rotating system for choosing a designated driver, and it's your turn.
Got it.
Full disclosure, I forgot we were doing this new system.
I got off work early.
I've been here for about an hour, and I'm already pretty drunk.
Someone else will do it.
Good call.
Guess the only place I'll be driving is through the giant loophole in the system I accidentally discovered.
Beep! Beep! [laughs.]
[slurping.]
Whoo! - Whoa! - [people cheering.]
I can't believe they've managed to mix one million flavors together, and yet, somehow, I can taste each individual one.
It's remarkable.
I got no-flavor.
- It's all I deserve, really.
- No.
Look, I I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.
I really do, but you don't understand.
This was the very first neighborhood that I got to design.
It was my chance to prove myself, and now I've blown it.
You know, sometimes a flaw can make something even more beautiful, like with Cindy Crawford and how short she is.
Oh, Tahani, if I made one tiny mistake in my design, if there's a single glitch in the system, if even one blade of grass is angled a a fraction of a degree off [dog whimpers.]
The whole neighborhood is compromised.
Whose dog is that? Guys, whose dog is that? Whose dog is that? See, this is one of those glitches I was talking about.
Nice try, puppy! [dog whimpering.]
[dog whimpers, pop.]
Whew! [chuckles.]
That was a close one.
Teacup? Hey, have you seen my dog? [grunts.]
Shouldn't these be magical trash bags? Five more minutes, flyers! Five more minutes! Oh, man, really? [bright instrumental music.]
Janet, I'm finished with cleanup, and I'm ready to fly.
- How do I start? - Hop on the launch pad and conjure an image that brings you pure joy.
Some people think of their wedding day or favorite vacation spot.
People puking on roller coasters.
People puking on roller coasters.
[gasps.]
[laughs.]
It's working! Ow! What the fork? [thunder crashing.]
Janet, any chance this is a scheduled trash storm? So here's the situation, Pevita.
I kind of kicked your dog into the sun.
But I got her back.
- [dog whimpers and growls.]
- Everything everything seems fine.
Teacup, thank goodness you're okay.
Everyone, it is merely a construct of a dog.
It feels no pain or joy or love.
Teacup doesn't love me? Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it definitely feels love.
Do you actually want a dog that loves you a little bit more? Because I can kick her right back into the sun and get you another one just like that.
- No! - Oh, boy.
I'm making things worse.
Okay, all right, that's all right.
Breathe.
Breathe do you breathe? - Mm-hmm.
- If you do, then just breathe 'cause everything's fine, Michael, it's fine.
Ooh! [wind whistling.]
It's raining garbage.
Run! Ooh, ooh, no, no, no, I'm gonna run this way.
[garbage clattering.]
Chidi! Hey.
Before you say anything That's it, I just don't want you to say anything.
- What did you do? - Nothing! It just started raining trash out of nowhere for no reason at all.
- [thunder crashes.]
- [screams.]
Oh okay, fine, fine.
My bag broke, and I ditched the trash instead of taking it all the way to the dumpster.
But in my defense, there were only five minutes left in flying and I wanted to go flying.
How is that a defense? You made a bad choice.
I made a bad choice? We could have literally been flying, and all you wanted to do was talk about morals.
I mean, you're like the worst part of Superman.
This is a relief.
I can stop my deliberations.
You're a selfish person, and it is pointless to help you.
You are on your own.
Oh, man.
[laughing.]
How 'bout this trash storm, Gunnar? More cleaning up to do.
It's a it's a dream come true.
[gasps.]
[both exhale.]
We're okay! You can't die here.
Come on, I mean, even you have to admit, those guys are psycho.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I mean, it's my duty to be calm and in control and I'm falling apart.
No, Michael, you are a paragon of fortitude.
You're a mountain of strength.
I'm not a mountain of strength.
I'm a canyon full of poo-poo.
[sobbing.]
Jianyu, the architect of this neighborhood has just referred to himself as a canyon full of poo-poo.
Surely now, you will say something? Grace us with your vocalized wisdom.
Please, I'm begging you.
[gentle piano music.]
Oh.
Yes, yes, I understand.
The strength is inside me.
It's been there all along.
No, of course, I can overcome any obstacle.
Oh, thank you, Jianyu, thank you.
[laughs.]
I'm back.
You did it.
Oh, you have so much to teach me.
Maybe I should try to be silent too.
No really, look.
Here I go.
Oh! That was wonderful! So cleansing.
[eerie music.]
[laughter.]
Just water tonight, huh? Designated driver? Yeah, it sucks.
I think it's awesome.
I mean, someone's got to do it, right? I think it's a cool thing to do for people.
Yeah.
No no, I meant I meant I it sucks that I can't do it more often, you know? I actually prefer it to drinking.
Staying sober and knowing my friends will get home safe, that's my buzz.
Hey, guys, good news and bad news.
See that hot bartender over there? He's into me, and we're gonna bang it out.
The bad news is, it means I can't drive you guys home.
But I did call a cab for you guys.
But they recognized my number, and they didn't want to come.
I've thrown up in a lot of cabs.
So are we good here? Eleanor, you have a very important choice to make.
If you blow us off, you are banned from Thursday night drinks forever.
Yeah, I'm good with that.
I'll see you guys at work.
Peace! You, let's go.
[sighs.]
Hey.
How did you know I was here? I saw you from my window.
That's where I live, by the way.
Not that you ever asked.
What are you doing? I went to all the places where I dumped trash earlier and cleaned it up so it couldn't be traced back to me.
Well, it looks like you cleaned up everything.
You're doing this because you feel bad.
And you're not even doing it to get me to help you anymore because I told you that's not gonna happen.
Okay, yeah, fine, I felt bad for stupid Gunnar and stupider Antonio and the whole neighborhood.
I felt bad about what I did.
It was a weird feeling.
Not used to it.
Didn't love it.
Well, feeling remorse about being wrong isn't as good as just doing something right, but it's a start.
Look, I think you're capable of change.
And I will help you try.
Oh, wow, man, I swear I won't let you down.
Hi there.
I've collected the worst-smelling garbage that I could find.
Do you still want me to dump it inside of Antonio's house? What? No.
I did not tell you to do that.
You are loco, girlfriend.
Okay, I won't let you down starting now.
[chuckling.]
Ah, Eleanor.
- Good morning.
- Michael.
Do you know what the best part about this place is? You figured out how to make a to-go cup that doesn't leak right where the seam meets the lid.
Oh, I'm so glad you noticed.
I was very proud of that.
One of the hardest problems I had to solve.
Eleanor, I know what you did.
Cleaning up the entire neighborhood by yourself.
[laughs.]
I knew you were special, but this is proof.
Enjoy your coffee.
And the cup.
Okay, let's begin your ""good person"" lessons.
You got a long way to go to pull this off.
It will take hours and hours of studying ethics and moral philosophy.
We're gonna have assignments and quizzes and papers.
It's gonna be so much fun.
Remind me what I'm getting out of this again.
You get to avoid eternal damnation.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Hey, I got you a present.
What? Senegal.
That's not a present; that's just common decency.
Yeah, but I forkin' nailed it.
Good talk.
[tense music.]
Ah, shirt.",success
30,That '70s Show,"Eric.
It is time.
Why don't you do it? - It's your house.
- Your house.
Listen to them up there.
The party has reached critical mass.
In 10 minutes, there will be no more beer opportunities.
If my dad catches me copping beers, he'll kill me.
I'm willing to take that risk.
Don't worry about it.
Just remain calm, keep moving.
And above all, don't get sucked into my dad's hair.
- What's wrong with your dad's hair? - Just don't look at it.
And, Eric, cold.
Definitely cold.
Young and beautiful Someday your looks will be gone Watch it, Eric! Hot pizza rolls.
Coming through.
Hot, hot.
Kitty, where are you? Okay, take two.
There's plenty.
There's plenty coming.
Is everybody good? I know.
I know.
Vienna sausages are so versatile.
Hi, there, Eric.
Mr.
Pinciotti.
So, Eric, how do you like Bob's new hair? Isn't it groovy? It's incredibly groovy, Mrs.
Pinciotti.
- Yeah, it was Midge's idea.
- It's a perm.
Eric.
Hi, Dad.
What the hell happened to Bob's hair? Beats me.
His head looks like a poodle's ass.
Boy, just when you think you've seen everything.
- A poodle's ass walks into your party.
- Eric, don't use the ""ass"" word.
You're still in high school.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Pigs in a blanket.
Hot.
Hot.
Kitty, is that your Toyota in the drive? Red, a Toyota? Yeah, it's mine.
I tell you, the last time I was that close to a Japanese machine it was shooting at me.
Honey, it is the gas crisis.
What can you do? And you know, Bob, those SOBs at the dealership offered me a lousy $400 trade-in on the Vista Cruiser.
Yeah, what you gonna do? It'll rust in the driveway before I trade it in.
Honey, it is rusting in the driveway.
Pop, I'll take the cruiser off your hands.
I don't care if it's a pump-sucker.
- What you got there, Eric? - Beer.
I found it.
Just sitting you know around.
Put them away, son.
I intend to, sir.
Honey.
On your way to the basement, could you pop these in the fridge? They're warm.
Check it out.
I see that every day.
He's alive! Good news.
My dad is thinking of giving me the Vista Cruiser.
You're getting a car? Have I told you how incredibly attractive you are, Eric? No.
You told me he was cute.
No, I didn't.
I remember, 'cause you said not to say anything in front of Eric.
Let's focus on what's important here, people.
Forman stole something.
To Forman.
You know what's sad? This is the proudest day of my life.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Marcia, a football in the face.
- That's gotta hurt.
- Ouch, my nose! - That's gonna be huge in the morning.
- Huger than my boobs? Bigger than the left one.
Why are we watching this without the sound? I am totally confused.
Here, use the earphone.
So, what's the deal with the Vista Cruiser? The deal is, there is no deal yet.
- How we gonna get to the concert? - Shut up! What concert? Todd Rundgren.
When? - This weekend.
- Who's going? Eric, and Donna, and me, and Hyde, and the foreign kid Fez.
Pretty much everybody.
- And you.
- Good.
Thank you for telling me, Michael.
- I'm getting a soda.
- Yeah.
Yep, me, too.
Sit down! You don't want me to go to the concert.
Is that it? I didn't know if you liked music.
Michael.
I didn't invite you to the concert because I know you really don't like my friends.
- Did you tell them that? - No.
Michael.
Don't tell our private conversations to other people.
We have to have our own private conversations.
Also, I didn't think you'd be interested in Todd Rundgren.
I mean, like you said, he's no Frampton.
I love Todd Runddamen.
I have the 45 of Hello, it's me.
Remember the night we listened to it? We can have fun at the concert, too.
Especially in the car on the way back.
- Okay.
You can go.
- Only if you want me to.
I want you to.
Jackie, I guess you're going to the concert with us.
I can't wait.
So, Michael, you wanna go back to my house and listen to Todd Grunion records? Yeah, sure.
Okay, bye.
You kids have fun.
Bye.
- Bye, bye, now.
- Yeah.
They're so darn cute.
Minute you turn your back, they go at it like dogs.
- They're frisky.
- You can't leave them alone.
No.
You know my sister thinks that we shouldn't be left alone.
Us? Yeah.
We're alone now.
Yeah.
Eric, relax.
We've lived next door to each other forever.
You could've had me when I was four.
Really? And there I was all day long on the hippity hop.
Stupid.
Stupid.
Stupid.
Ever since yesterday, I can't stop thinking about you.
I mean, I've known you practically my whole life.
I want you.
I want you so bad.
Eric, it's a car.
Let's just leave these two kids alone.
Say, hey there, Donna.
Hey, Dad.
You kids.
Standing around the driveway.
It's so darn cute.
You know, you may not realize it but this is the most fun you're ever gonna have.
- So it's all downhill from here, sir? - Yeah.
- What happened to your dad's hair? - He got a permanent.
So that's permanent? Baby! I may not say this right because I am new to English.
But she has tremendous breasts, yes? Michael, who is this guy? That's Fez.
He's a foreign exchange student.
Who did we exchange for him? Donna, I have to go to the ladies' room.
Donna? I, too, must go to the bathroom.
Eric? No, it doesn't work that way with guys.
Kelso, how much longer are we gonna have to deal with the whole Jackie experience? Don't worry.
I'm breaking up with her.
- Never gonna happen.
- It's over.
She's cutting into my free time.
I I'm hooked on a feeling I'm high on believing So is Red still thinking about giving you the car maybe? Even if we do get it, we're gonna need some serious gas money 'cause the cruiser's a boat.
I know it's a boat.
This whole gas shortage bites.
Who is getting a boat? There is no gas shortage, man.
It's all fake.
The oil companies control everything.
Like, there's this guy who invented this car that runs on water, man.
It's got a fiberglass air-cooled engine, and it runs on water.
So it is a boat.
No, it's a car.
Only, you put water in the gas tank instead of gas.
And it runs on water, man.
I never heard of this car.
Jackie's good for gas money.
You are such a whore.
When does the boat get here, whore? Eric! Yeah, dad.
I need to talk to you.
Eric your mother and I have been talking.
Since I've been cut back to part-time at the plant and the hospital is so close I can take the Toyota to work, and your mom can take the bus.
Honey.
Honey, really, I'd rather walk.
When I ride the bus in my nurse's uniform, people always show me their scars.
Then I'll drop you off on my way to the plant.
- No, I don't wanna be any trouble.
- Then Eric can take you.
He's a teenager.
He doesn't wanna drop If he can't drop his own mother off at work, then I'll be damned if he's getting a car! Okay.
Excuse me.
- Am I getting the car? - We didn't say that.
Things don't just drop into your lap, Eric.
Not in this life.
A car is a responsibility.
You'll need insurance.
Do you have any idea how much insurance is? A car is a privilege.
Oil changes, road flares, fluids, that's your job.
A car is not a bedroom on wheels.
Always yield.
Always! Laurie's friend got pregnant in a car.
Don't let that happen.
If I find one beer can in that car, it's over.
And no doughnuts, either.
Ants.
So do I get the car? - Bitching! - Eric, not in front of your mother.
Thank you, Pop.
Sir.
Yeah clean the attic.
- Kelso, that's sweet.
- Actually, I'm riding shotgun.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not riding in the back.
Why don't we let Eric decide? - Eric? - Kelso.
Get in the back.
- Taking her for a spin? - Yes, sir.
Have a good time.
One more thing.
Very important.
About the car.
She's old, so no trips out of town.
Ever.
Understood? Have fun.
I guess that's that.
We're not going.
- Eric, do you wanna go? - He said no trips out of town.
- It's your car.
Do you wanna go? - But he's God.
I think God would want us to go to Milwaukee.
Eric, you are a 17-year-old man.
I'm gonna go with whatever you say.
It's your decision.
It is my decision.
And my decision is: - We're going to a concert.
- Yeah! The kids are off.
I wonder where they're going.
Out of town.
Are you sure? Of course.
I told them not to.
So I guess they'll be gone for a while.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'm telling you, we're out of gas.
- We're not out of gas.
- It's the battery.
- It's six years old and shot to hell.
- I know what.
I'll just call my dad.
Kelso, tell her.
- He can't take the car out of town.
- I'm not calling his dad.
Jackie, parents talk to each other about how we screw up.
- Why would they talk about that? - They can't help it.
Look, say there's a party, see.
And all of our parents are there.
Together.
Hi, Red.
Say, isn't it great all our kids are such good friends? Yes, Jackie's dad, they're quite the gang of young people.
Kitty, I love what you've done with the kitchen.
Yes, aqua and yellow blah, blah, blah, yak, yak, yak.
Speaking of kids wasn't it lucky Triple-A pulled Eric's butt out of the fire when he took the car to Milwaukee without your permission? What? Why, that twisted little monkey! I'm grounding him for 10 years.
Kids.
What are you gonna do? I say we torture them with plenty of pointless rules and advice.
Hey, everybody! Let's hustle! Guys.
We are in the middle of nowhere and I have to go to the ladies' room.
Donna? So where you going? - Rundgren concert.
- Cool.
So what, you want a battery? 'Cause I can get you a battery.
Are they cheap? Or possibly free? $32, minimum.
All right, I'll tell you what.
We'll trade you our battery, plus $5 for one of your batteries.
That's a really sweet deal, my friend, but how about this? How about one battery for two concert tickets? We can't give up two tickets.
Okay.
It's either that or none of us go.
- So who's out? - There's always Jackie.
Of course, Jackie.
I mean, Jackie's gone.
But who else? I don't know.
Jackie's date? Come on! You know I'm breaking up with her.
- You guys are chumping me out.
- I've had to listen to her for a good hour.
A really long hour.
God hates me.
How can you say God hates you? At least you have a woman's love.
Be happy, whore.
This suit is for leisure.
But many times I wear it to get down to business.
Guys.
Randy's date is a man.
I'm okay with it.
We are so cool to be okay with it.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Kevin? I'll explain later.
This isn't working.
No, it's a Boy Scout belt.
The buckle's got a thing you No.
Michael, before you speak, please hear my words.
I think we should break up.
- Now? - You're not having a good time.
- I'm having a good time.
- Really? Yeah.
Michael, I am so glad you don't wanna break up.
You were so nice to give your ticket away, so you could be with me.
Yeah.
That says you don't need music concerts friends.
You know what you need, Michael? - I don't know.
- Me.
M-E, Michael.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.
You're just too shy to say that, lover.
So when were you a Boy Scout? What a great night.
You know, it's amazing what one act of civil disobedience can do for you.
I mean, there's a whole world that's waiting to be driven to.
We could go to Canada.
We got a new battery, what's stopping us? You know, I think Canada closes at 9:30.
Yeah.
You know, I never would have done this if you hadn't talked me into it.
I didn't talk you into anything.
I'm gonna call it a day.
Good night.
Night.
By the way, thanks for the ride.
What was that for? I just wanted to see what it was like.
What was it like? You were there.
Yeah, I wasn't ready for it.
What would you have done differently? I don't know.
Something with my lips? Sounds good.
Let's try that next time.
When exactly is next time? Good night.
Yeah, I'm really gonna sleep after that.
It's important to me That you know you are free 'Cause I'd never want to Make you change for me Boy, we're good.
Yeah, really good.",success
31,Parks and Recreation,"Hello.
Hi.
My name is Leslie Knope, and I work for the Parks and Recreation Department.
Can I ask you a few questions? Would you say that you are, ""Enjoying yourself and having fun, ""having a moderate amount of fun ""and somewhat enjoying yourself, ""or having no fun and no enjoyment?"" I'm gonna put a lot of fun.
Ms.
Knope, there's a drunk stuck in the slide.
Sir, this is a children's slide.
You're not allowed to sleep in here.
What is? LESLIE You know, when I first tell people that I work in the government, they say, ""Oh.
The government.
The government stinks.
""The lines are too long at the DMV.
"" But now things have changed.
People need our help.
And it feels good to be needed.
Could you put your arms to your side? Wait And that might help you slide down a little easier.
We don't Do you want to come this way? Uh-uh.
Okay, we're gonna need you to get out.
Can you please go away? Get out of the slide.
Okay? You're Can you please go away? Here we go! Okay, wake up.
Here we go.
Out of the slide.
LESLIE You know, government isn't just a boys' club anymore.
Women are everywhere.
It's a great time to be a woman in politics.
Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, me, Nancy Pelosi.
We did it! You know, I like to tell people, you know, ""Get on board and buckle up, ""because my ride's gonna be a big one.
"" And if you get motion sickness, you know, put your head between your knees 'cause Leslie Knope's stopping for no one.
Tonight is our next monthly community outreach public forum.
And that is tonight.
That is tonight.
Right.
Leslie will be running it.
And we need one more.
Who wants in? Tom.
Fine.
LESLIE This is a great thing for you guys to see.
This is where the rubber of government meets the road of actual human beings.
When I go through these doors, I need to be on.
Like the White House Press Secretary.
Are you ready? Yeah.
Okay.
Here we go.
It's locked.
Okay.
Here we go.
Thank you so much for coming.
What an amazing turnout.
My name is Leslie Knope.
I am the deputy director of the Parks and Recreation Department, and tonight we're gonna be taking some of your questions as Hello? We're having a meeting in here.
Does anybody have any questions about permits? So, take two.
I'm Leslie Knope, and with me is department member Tom Haverford.
We are here to answer any and all of your questions, so fire away.
Well, it's a great day, because last month they put me in jail.
That's right.
The head of the police is a ninth-degree Mason.
But the music is so loud.
Stop the graffiti, please.
Please.
I don't like obscenities just as much as you don't like them.
No, it drives me crazy.
I have kids.
Right.
But I've got my little three-year-old, I'm going through the park and someone's like, ""Hey my "" And the guy's, ""You my, you head.
"" These people are members of a community that care about where they live, so what I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me.
Now, I have a few things I want to say about Laura Linney.
Thank you so much, Barry.
Always great to have you here.
Anyone else who would like to contribute? Hi.
Hi, hi.
Hi.
I'm Ann Perkins.
I'm a nurse, and frankly, I don't really care for politics, but I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.
Excellent.
That sounds like a good idea.
Tell us about that.
No, it's a problem.
It almost killed my boyfriend.
Oh.
Yeah.
There's a lot nearby my house, and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt, so there's just this giant pit, and it's been there for almost a year.
Twelve months, yes.
Go on.
Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a musician, actually, I support him, but anyway, he fell in and broke both his legs.
Ann, let me speak with you for a minute.
So, your boyfriend fell down into this pit, right? Yes.
And, this guy, is it pretty serious? Are you guys living together? Yes.
Wow, I'm sure this must be really tough for you.
You know, just, this guy, sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken.
He's just weak.
You have to take care of him.
You probably feel like you need to move on.
What does this Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body, just in Are you actually hitting on me right now? Oh.
Oh.
God, no.
I'm not hitting on you.
I'm actually married.
I'm just an open person, and I like connecting with people.
I'm, you know, very comfortable around women, attractive women.
I've spent a lot of time with them.
And I just I don't know.
I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.
Maybe we can just exchange numbers.
You know, maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this.
Look I'd love to do it.
The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's government-owned, and you need to do something about it.
Okay.
I'll do something about it.
Really? Yes, we I will help you.
Is that a promise? It's more than a promise.
It's a pinky promise.
I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land.
Okay.
LESLIE Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of.
Recently, I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats.
But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam.
No, that sounds great.
Problem is, anything over $25 I have to report, so maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll give them to me.
Morning.
All right, Mr.
Mayor.
That sounds good.
I'll see you on Saturday for the Ultimate Frisbee game.
Bye.
Leslie, hello.
You were talking to the mayor? Yep, we were just rapping about some things.
Tom and I work really well together.
We're both outsiders.
I'm a woman, he's a I think he's a Libyan.
I am from Bennettsville, South Carolina.
I am what you might call a redneck.
Okay, brainstorm.
How do we make this park happen? Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.
No, parks are not a priority.
I need more firepower.
I need bigger guns.
You know what I need to do? Form a committee.
Right? Yeah, that could work.
Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen.
Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.
That's really good.
Write that down.
Yep.
From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down.
He's collecting them for my memoirs.
Here's Leslie's quote from Wednesday.
Okay, read it back to me.
Um ""Committees cover our democracy with blood.
"" Hmm.
Sounded better when I said it.
It's still good, though.
Okay, I have an idea.
What about bringing Mark on board? Which Mark? Which Mark? Mark Brendanawicz.
Which Mark? Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that.
He's kind of like a fixer.
He fixes things.
He's a smart, capable guy.
He just He knows where the bodies are buried.
What's up, Brendanawicz? You crazy old Polish person.
LESLIE City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you Then you can't take it.
You gotta leave the locker room.
Let's get down to brass tacks.
I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.
I just work right there.
Well, thank you for clearing your schedule.
I didn't clear anything.
You know this lot that I'm talking about, right? Yeah, Lot 48.
Condo developer.
He dug a basement, and then he went bankrupt.
I checked it out like a month ago.
It's pretty gross.
What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park? A park, huh? Okay.
Well, when I think about the logistics, the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through, I would say, is it likely? No, it's not likely, you know.
But, is it possible? No.
It's not possible.
I would give up on that one.
What? Why? Why? I don't know.
There's like a million reasons why.
Homeowners' associations, anti-government nuts, bureaucrats, miles of red tape Really? It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.
There's no way it can happen.
I can do this.
I just need a little help.
Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake? Mark and I It's complicated.
When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen.
We slept together.
Leslie? No.
Oh, my God.
You know what? Yeah, we did, like, five years ago.
I sort of No, but yeah.
Yeah, we did.
Honey, can you straighten up your area a little bit? 'Cause they're gonna be here soon.
Can Thanks.
That parks lady is coming over, and we're gonna go take a look at the pit.
I think it's probably just a photo op for her.
I mean, I don't think anybody in government actually cares about Honey, do you mind doing that somewhere else? I'm trying to watch TV.
I'm talking about the pit you fell in.
It's Ms.
Perkins' house.
Doorbell! Yeah, I heard it.
Doorbell! I heard it.
I'm getting it.
I'm here.
Hey! Wow! Look at that.
Safety.
You remember Tom from last night.
Hey, Ann, how are you? Yeah, hey.
Of course I do.
And this is our college intern, April.
She's going to be documenting our fact-finding mission.
Hey, April.
Hey.
Is this fun for you? Yeah, it's so much fun.
I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.
Sorry.
This must be our hero.
The man heard 'round the world.
Uh-huh.
How you doing, son? Pretty good.
I'm Leslie Knope.
And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.
Could you pass me my itch stick? Of course.
So, Andy jumped over this fence.
He was crossing through to get home, and then he fell right there.
Oh, my God.
How did we let this happen? Dream with me for a second, Ann.
Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park? Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field.
We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.
It's really not that big of a pit.
We could do some of those things.
It's gonna take a little extra work.
But why not try? I think that would be great.
Me, too.
I'm going in.
Why? Don't worry.
I have a hard hat on.
I can see that, but Yeah.
April, document this.
Document what? The key to any fact-finding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know? It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.
No! Leslie, are you okay? Leslie! Hold on, April's gonna get some photos for the website.
Could you just be still? Don't move around as much.
Okay, squeeze my fingers.
Good.
Does it hurt a lot? No.
Mmm-mmm.
I'm fine.
No, you're not.
Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.
But it It fell off.
After my head hit that rod.
Wow.
I can't believe you fell in, too.
That's awesome.
It's not awesome, Andy.
Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle.
It's not broken.
It is.
Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things? Honestly, you're fine.
Honestly, my clavicle's broken.
Oh, hey, baby, if you're going to the kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick? Sure.
Ooh! Are pancakes being made? Thank you.
Sure.
I don't know, she's a little doofy, but she's sweet.
LESLIE Ron, please.
No.
No way.
Come on, Ron.
I've been a loyal foot soldier.
Give me my shot.
Let me have Lot 48.
Is that a travel pillow around your neck? Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you.
When you've been down in the pit Have you been in the pit? No, I haven't gotten down there yet.
Well, I have.
When you fell in.
When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact-finding mission.
And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means.
And let me tell you something, Ron.
What it means is I want this subcommittee.
I've been quite open about this around the office.
I don't want this Parks Department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.
I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.
My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.
Like Chuck E.
Cheese.
They have an impeccable business model.
I would rather work for Chuck E.
Cheese.
Well, I will definitely think about it.
I like the sound of that definitely.
I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.
Mr.
Swanson, I presume.
Lot Park? Giving the park to me? Still mulling.
RON She's insatiable.
She's like a little dog with a chew toy.
All right, you guys.
All right, all right.
I'll ask him.
Everybody wants to know what your decision is.
Someone on the phone about the park.
You know, I don't think I even want it.
Oh.
Man, my clavicle's still really hurting me.
Oh! This is a great shot.
I know.
That's awesome.
I think she's crying in that one.
Look at this one.
Hey, kids.
That's another good one.
Hey.
Hey, Brendanawicz.
You gotta come check this out.
Leslie took us out to that pit in Lot 48, and she fell inside.
And we have some awesome photos.
One.
Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine.
Oh! This is a classic.
That's the best one.
The up-skirt photo.
Awesome.
Hey, man.
Give me the photo back.
What's going on? Don't worry.
I can print more.
Leslie is unique.
Government work can beat you down.
I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.
Leslie's kept hers for six years.
I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules.
I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.
Why should I? You owe me one, remember? Do you want to cash in for this? Yeah, I do.
LESLIE So this was built in And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks.
Wow! Oh, yeah.
This is our crown jewel.
It's one of our best murals.
It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.
We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster.
That is horrifying.
Yes, it is.
So, what do you want to see? The DMV? Animal control? Or we could Leslie! We did it.
Ron's approved our committee.
Oh, my God.
That's great! That's so great.
That's so exciting! This is huge.
I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a Parks Department exploratory subcommittee.
I'm a rocket ship.
Leslie.
I just heard the news.
Hey.
Isn't it great? Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'm so excited.
It's exciting, isn't it? It is.
Yeah.
Should I call a press conference now, or Yeah, call one.
Definitely.
I would.
Every now and then we have these little gatherings, and Leslie gets plastered.
One time I convinced her to try to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up.
She one time made out with the water-delivery guy in her office.
On Halloween, she was dressed up as Batman.
Not Batgirl.
Batman.
And I convinced her to go stop a crime that was going on outside.
And it is my favorite thing in the world.
You know what? America is awesome.
It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys.
You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike.
Yeah.
You gotta be ready for it.
Yeah.
Are you excited? Definitely am.
Fired up.
Yeah! I'm really fired up.
I You know they say that democracy or whatever only works when people get involved? Well, I'm getting involved.
So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do whatever it takes to get this pit filled in.
Even if it takes two months.
Soul sista, soul sista Gonna get your phone, sista Yeah.
Sweet Lady Marmalard I've created this office as a symbol of how I feel about government.
This sawed-off shotgun belonged to a local bootlegger.
People who come in here to ask me for things have to stare right down the barrel.
Did you guys get a grant to do this? This is my basketball court.
I don't want to see any double dribble.
I don't want to see any three-second violations.
Bobby Knight!",success
32,New Girl,"So you know in horror movies when the girl's like: ""Oh, my God, there's something in the basement.
Let me just run down there in my underwear and see what's going on.
"" And you're like, ""What is your problem? Call the police.
"" She's like, ""Okay,"" but it's too late because she's getting murdered? Well, my story's kind of like that.
JESS: It's a surprise for Spencer.
I'm gonna walk in, gonna drop my coat on the ground.
He says he had this fantasy that I'm a stripper with a heart of gold and he's helping me put myself through college.
He didn't say the college part, did he? Um, no.
I wanted to create a three-dimensional sex character.
CECE: Really? What's your stripper name? Uh Rebecca Johnson.
Your stripper name's Rebecca Johnson? Boobies Johnson.
""Two Boobs"" Johnson.
Look at you, in the back of the cab, totally naked.

SCHMlDT: Okay.
- What are you doing? COACH: Wow.
SCHMlDT: Mm-hm.

SCHMlDT: Are you serious? COACH: Yeah.

Spencer hated light.
- It's hard to say his name.
SCHMlDT: It's okay.
Nick knows.
He got dumped.
Dumped.
Yeah, I got dumped.
I can't hear you.
That means we're not breaking up.
- I can't hear you.
La-la-la! - I'm breaking up with you.
Yeah, I got dumped.
She dumped me.
And I'm over it.
Okay? It was six months ago, guys.
Get past it.
I don't even know why we're still talking about it.
Why's everybody looking at me? You know what, I wanna live here.
Actually, I still have some questions.
No offense, you know, but we barely know you.
Yeah, okay, yeah.
So full disclosure I'm kind of emotional right now because of the breakup so I'll probably be watching Dirty Dancing at least six or seven times a day.
Um, I'm a teacher, so I bring home a lot of Popsicle sticks, stuff like that.
Also, I like to sing to myself a lot.
[SlNGlNG.]
A lot I'm tired of living with my friend.
She's a model.
All her friends are models.

Her friends are models.
Okay, you guys? Models.
I say no.
I need to be able to come home from work sit on my couch and let my beans out, let them breathe.
Nick, it's all you, buddy.
First let me say, I think you guys make interesting points points I respect, but I will say this.
I have lived with a woman, Caroline and I know there are pros and I know there are real cons.
- Nick, you're weak! - Okay, pro, they smell nice.
Cons, every once in a while, the mood changes and you're not sure why.
They'll ruin your life if you let them.
They'll break down your will to live.
- Pros, they're good at folding.
- Make a decision! I'm sorry.
But another pro, like - Oh, don't do it.
- I'm gonna.
Put it down.
Don't hood me.
You guys don't know what you're talking about.
- I know what I'm talking about.
- Pushed him too hard.
We did.
How about this? Executive decision.

You have no idea what I'm going through at work.
I'm trying to do my work.
I'm trying to do a good job here.
Nice tie.
Can I borrow a tampon? [WOMEN LAUGHlNG.]
- Schmidt, I'm not calling her.
- Listen to me.
Knowing that I will be going to the Wild Wild West Charity Auction for Poverty reminds me that I'm still a man and I can still motorboat a hot girl who is also a member of the Cherokee Nation which is not racist, because it is for a good cause.
JESS: Somebody's in here.
- We're leaving in 10.
You shave your legs? JESS: I will now.
- Front and backs? JESS: Yes.
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- Call Caroline.
- You call her when you're drunk.
- Don't know to what you are referring.
[lN ENGLlSH ACCENT.]
Hello, Caroline.
I still love you.
So much.
[lN NORMAL VOlCE.]
So much.
I'm not calling her.
Schmidt, I know you really wanna go to this party but wouldn't it be better to find a girl who you really care about to motorboat? Then maybe, if you're super-lucky you might find a girl who'll motorboat you right back.
I don't think she knows what motorboating is.
SCHMlDT: Jess, we are leaving in five.
- Hey.
Hey, Coach, what's-- ? Oh! Sorry.
Uh, my boss says that I don't know how to talk to women, which is ridiculous.
Spin, woman! Spin! Aah! - I am spinning! - Go! - You're so mean! - I'm not mean, I'm trying to help you! I'm trying to help you! So I was wondering if you could help me out with that.
Sure, sure, absolutely.
Um Well, first of all, maybe think about what women like to talk about.
- You know, like use me for practice.
- All right.
Um, ahem.
Shopping.
Is that fun for you guys? Yeah.
Shopping's fun.
Uh, the other day, I bought a pair of jeggings.
They look like jeans, but they're really leggings.
Uh Uh You I Who cares?! Sorry.
Um Good job.
A couple things you could work on.
Uh One, lowering your voice.
- Right on.
- Um, two, listening.
- Uh, three, rage.
- Absolutely.
- Um, four - Your hair is on fire.
[HlP-HOP MUSlC PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS.]
Beers and a rosé.
Pink wine makes me slutty.
Whoa.
Cute-guy alert.
[GlBBERlNG.]
Okay, Jess, game time.
Let's do this.
You wanna forget about Spencer you're gonna have to do some very, very bad things with that man right over there.
- How bad? - Real bad, Jess.
Real bad.
Like a make-out sesh, no tops.
Okay, this is what-- This is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna go over there and you're gonna stand next to him and you're gonna smile.
You're not gonna smile like that.
You look like a hungry badger.
- Stop that.
- Okay, I got this, I got this.
You got it.
Go make it happen.
COACH: Get 'em up! Grind it out.
SCHMlDT: Go do it.
Grind it out! Ha, ha! Hey, sailor.
- Oh.
All right.
That's okay.
- All right.
- Maybe he didn't hear that.
- You can come back.
Holy Schmidt, it's Schmidt.
Oh, it is all about the Benjamin.
- What's up? BENJAMlN: What's up, man? All right.
P-Funk, what's up, dude? - This is Coach.
- What's up, Coach? You like parties? - Don't talk to me.
BENJAMlN: Yeah, okay.
- You know who likes to party, right? PETER: Yeah.
You coming on Saturday? There's gonna be some fine ladies there.
I heard it's not gonna be that good this year.
No? - Are you not on the list? - Man, I'm on the list.
- You know that.
- That sucks, man.
- Keep your head up, all right? - All right, player.
Do your thing.
- Take her sleazy, man.
- All right, man.
P-Funk, always.
- Please.
- Why are you friends with those guys? - Get me in the party.
I'm begging you.
- I'm not calling.
You know what a cute cowboy I am? You have any idea? - Well, I guess I can't hide my crazy.
- I don't think you're trying that hard.
Well, I've never really been great at this stuff, so [SlNGlNG.]
What if God was one of us? Make it stop! Just a slob like one of us Look at us.
Couple of losers.
We both got dumped.
Jeesh.
I'm fine.
Six months ago, so Do you know why she dumped you? She must have hurt you bad.
It made no difference to me.
I wanted to set her trash on fire.
So you were always just, like, wondering, like, ""What was it? Was there something I could have done differently?"" You know what happens to people who keep it all inside? They get old, and they get sad, and they get weird.
Then you're the old man yelling at the kids running across your yard.
And you're telling them, ""Don't run across my yard.
My life's filled with regret.
"" You know, you can't just pretend like it didn't happen.
Or I could pretend to be more like you, Jess and live on a sparkly rainbow and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time.
Yeah, I think you should sing all the time.
No, I was being mean.
I'm not gonna do that.
Why not? It's fun.
Because I have a penis.
[SlNGlNG.]
My name is Nick I have a penis And I'm not gonna let any feelings out Okay, Jess, your left boob is resting on a plate of chicken wings.
Yeah.
I know.
Hey.
I'm Peter.
- What are you drinking? JESS: Oh, I'll have another pink wine.
PETER: I like your glasses.
JESS: They help me see.
[LAUGHS.]
- She's doing all right.
- Mm-hm.
Schmidt stain.
Hey, man, I was thinking, it's probably better that you don't come to the party.
That means more breasts for me.
Ha-ha-ha.
You better step down.
You're taking this too far.
I'm ser-- Hold me back, Coach.
I'm ser-- Hold me back.
Hold me back.
- Coach, would you please hold me back? - No.
We're going to the party.
Relax.
- Nice.
See you there, Schmitty.
- Totally, broseph.
- Yeah, I texted Caroline.
- You texted Caroline? It's no big deal.
It's behind me.
It's in the past, so - Thank you.
I love you, bro.
NlCK: Yeah, there it is.
- Did you just kiss my arm? - You bet I did.
It felt right.
- So I'll see you tomorrow, sailor.
- Yeah, cool.
Call-- Cool.
What's happening tomorrow, sailor? Know what? You guys were totally right.
I talked in short sentences, I didn't sing, I laughed, I smiled I said I needed rebound sex, and it totally worked.
He asked me out.
Dinner with food.
Ooh-ooh.
- I'm so proud of you.
- You got it, girl.
- Yeah, you put it down.
Mm.
- A date.
[SlNGlNG.]
It's Jess, she's on fire - She's on fire COACH & NlCK: Ah! COACH: She's got some big-ass panties.
- Should we tell her? - I think we let her have her moment.
Do the shoes fit, Jess? [THUD.]
JESS: I'm okay.
- What, are you a model or something? - Yeah.
Yes.
Mostly print right now, so What is it, Cece? Cecilia? Heh.
Checilia? Tell me, what are your hopes and dreams? You know, are you warm? - I'm a little warm.
- Don't.
All right.
Oh, yeah.
There it is.
Please put your shirt back on.
Please don't make me laugh at you.
Can I hit you up with some tea? A little herb tea.
Oh Oh, my God.
How good is that? For real? What? Little P-mint tea? Yum, right? Little hot, sweet.
Little tea bag action.
And I wasn't-- Heh, heh.
- I wasn't talking about-- - There it is.
- Douche-bag.
- Listen to me, you guys.
Jess is by far the best person that I know so if you guys let anything happen to her I'm gonna come here and crazy-murder you.
I'm gonna be honest with you.
I did not hear a word that you just said because I can see your party hats right now.
- There you go.
- Jess.
COACH: Yeah, right.
- Why are you talking like this? - I fell off my heels.
- Okay, all right.
No, come on.
- Get up.
- Oh, what am I doing? I can't go on a date.
What if it's horrible? What if I have nothing to talk about? You go to the bathroom, you call me, and you tell me all about it.
Maybe I just shouldn't go.
Babe, you got hurt.
That doesn't mean you stop trying.
Okay? - Okay.
- Okay, let's go.
Come on.
[CECE SlGHS.]
You gotta take off those overalls.
I was going for, like, a Like, a hot farmer's daughter kind of thing.
You know, like, ""Oh, I'm going to go milk my cows with my bucket.
"" - Take them off.
- Okay.
What am I gonna wear? Wow.
Thanks, Coach.
[BEATBOXlNG.]
And then she does that.
I'm gonna text him, tell him I'm headed over.
Wait.
Have you been texting him? Is that bad? No.
It's nice.
- Have a good night.
- This is gonna be great.
SCHMlDT: Coach, you don't look like an lndian.
I got your back.
You gotta have mine.
- Coach, I got your back.
- No, Nick.
- I wanna hear it from him.
- What sort of lndian wears bike shorts? NlCK: Excuse me.
Is Caroline-- ? I'm looking for Caroline.
- We're supposed to be on some list.
- Hey, Nick.
That's her.
Sorry I'm wearing this stupid thing.
Schmidt made me do it.
- Thank you so much for getting us in.
- Yeah.
No problem.
Um, maybe to pay me back, you can stop prank calling me.
- What? - Uh [lN ENGLlSH ACCENT.]
""Hello, Caroline.
I still loves you, I do.
"" Yeah, you gotta figure that out.
Some crazy person's calling you.
- Ha, ha.
- You look nice.
It's good to see you.
[lN NORMAL VOlCE.]
Um I think I'm almost finished out here if you Do you wanna go grab a drink? - Yeah.
- Yeah? Sure.
Yeah.
Let's you and I just get a drink.
- Let's get a drink.
- Be normal about it.
Actually, I'm sorry.
I have to ask you something so that one day I'm not an old man filled with regret.
But why did you dump me? Um Do-- ? Okay.
Are we doing this here, like, now? Yeah.
Why did you dump me? Um Honestly, l I didn't even realize that you cared about me until we broke up.
- Okay.
Let's get that drink.
BENJAMlN: Get along, little doggy.
Well, howdy there, muchachos.
Hey, where's Jess? Oh, dude, she texted me seven times.
Like, long ones.
I just wanna hook up.
So is she waiting for you to show up, or did you call her? Yeah, that's what I did.
I called her.
[PETER & BENJAMlN LAUGH.]
Are you kidding me? See you inside, Schmidt.
Nick? Wanna get that drink? No.
I gotta go help a friend, Caroline.
No, no, no.
This is the party of the year, you guys.
- This is our night.
- I'm going with Nick.
You coming? SCHMlDT: I thought you guys were my boys.
- ""My boys"" is not a thing.
Stop.
Yep.
We're coming, Jess! [GRUNTS.]
[CHATTERlNG.]
Do you have anything else that is free but also has bread in it? Because the-- The, like, good bread I ate, and the All that's left is, like, a-- It's, like-- It's kind of like a health bread.
I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to ask you to give up the table.
Um Can I please just stay just a little bit longer? NlCK: We're here.
COACH: Yup.
NlCK: We're here, Jess.
We're here.
- Here for the date.
- Date thing.
- Phew.
- You're all on a date? NlCK: Yeah.
We're her boyfriends.
We are reverse-Mormons.
- One man just isn't enough for her.
HOSTESS: Okay.
- Hey, Jess, that guy was a jerk.
- Yeah.
That guy's a clown.
You guys missed your party to come here and see me? Yeah.
We care about you.
We like you.
That's so nice.
- What is that? - Don't start crying.
- Come on.
- It's cool.
- It's very, very cool.
NlCK: Come on, Jess.
- Please? - Stop it! - Coach.
- All right.
It's okay.
Hey, don't cry.
[SlNGlNG.]
For I've had the time of my life COACH: What is he doing? And I've never felt this way before Yes, it's true Na, na, na, na, na And it's something, something, something There's beers in my house It's the song That makes you really happy I' m not participating in this.
Just remember, you're the one thing That I can't get enough of [LAUGHlNG.]
And I tell you something [SlNGlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY.]
I've had the time of my life And I owe it all to you Come on, what time is it? The time of my life Hey.
- That was nice, man.
- You have to leave now, all of you.
[COACH SlNGlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY.]
COACH & NlCK: The time of my life [SlNGlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY.]
[ON TV.]
Yes, I swear it's the truth It's the truth You were right, Jess.
This movie's pretty good.
Seriously, thank you guys so much for tonight.
That was really cool.
And I've searched Through every open door Listen, Jess, I know you've had a really rough go of it and I just want you to know that, I mean, for me, at least that no matter what I would still totally do you.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
- Jar.
- Yeah, jar.",success
33,The Middle,"Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Oh, damn it.
Come on.
FRANKIE: Some people call this the middle of nowhere.
You know, one of those places you fly over on your way from somewhere to somewhere else, but you wouldn't live here? Now we're flying over the great state of Indiana, if you'd like to take a look.
Look down next time.
You'll see us down here in the middle.
Orson, Indiana.
Heart of the heartland.
Proud home of Little Betty Snack Cakes, the demolition derby for the homeless and the world's largest polyurethane cow.
How'd I end up in the middle of the road in this getup? Here? No.
Oh, bars.
I got bars.
Ow.
Guess it all started a couple weeks ago.
And, no, I'm not an actual superhero.
Not unless you count getting my kids out for school every morning.
FRANKIE: I made breakfast.
Come on.
We're late.
Let's go.
Let's go.
That's my youngest, Brick.
You know how you think giving a kid a cool name will make him cool? It doesn't.
Okay.
Now, listen.
At recess, I don't want you wandering around alone on the perimeter.
All right? Makes you an easy target.
Like the gazelle that gets separated from the pack.
You gotta find yourself a group of kids and just stand near them.
- You know you're my hero, right, Mom? - Thank you, honey.
Eat your pancake.
- It's still frozen.
- Well, lick it.
It'll last longer.
Hey, Mike, have you seen that envelope with my driver's license from the DMV? I need it for work.
Why is this place such a mess? [GROANING.]
That one over there would be Axl.
Since he hit 15, he hibernates in his room and comes out to paw through our food and shoot off sarcastic comments.
Uh.
We're out of chips.
Nice job, Mom.
Yeah, I can't hear you if you don't have pants on.
Mom, where's my homework? Aha! Okay.
[FRANKIE GASPS.]
When did this happen? Mike, look.
Look at this.
I haven't had my license picture taken in seven years.
Here's the old one.
Look at this.
What happened to me? Well, back then you were all young and shiny and wondering what your life's gonna be, and now Well, now you know.
[GROANS.]
GIRL: Mom.
Come in here if you wanna talk to me.
Axl, put some pants on.
Okay, maybe it was just a bad picture.
I mean, yikes.
Mike, does it ever bum you out that I'm not young and shiny anymore? Sure, honey, it's a huge bummer.
But what are you gonna do? Oh, shoot, I wanted chips for my lunch.
AXL: She didn't buy any.
FRANKIE: Sue, grab a pancake.
We're late.
That's Sue.
She's been going through a bit of an awkward stage for the past 13 years.
Mom, the dryer ate my leg warmers again.
I told you, you can't put wet things in the dryer anymore.
Well, I need them because, guess what? I'm trying out for show choir this week.
I know, I know.
That's not an expression parents should have on their faces when their daughter is trying out for something.
But, see, Sue had a long history of things she tried out for.
A long and painful history.
[IN SPANISH.]
- Show choir? - Mm-hm.
Wow, super.
That should be fun to try out for.
Listen, Dad's gonna fix the dryer, but right now I need everybody to go.
Let's get out the door.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
That driver's license picture was a big wake-up call from the DMV.
Somehow the life had been sucked right out of me.
But who or what had sucked it? - Mom.
AXL: Mom.
- He's not giving me my backpack.
Mom.
AXL: Mom.
BRICK: Mom.
SUE: Mom.
We did teach them the word ""dad,"" didn't we? [LAUGHS.]
We're a two-job family.
Mike manages a bunch of boneheads down at the quarry.
Oh, for crying out loud.
My latest job I'm too smart for is selling cars at Orson's last car dealership.
Wow, wow, wow.
What a month, huh? Frankie, don't let him intimidate you.
He may be king of sales but he's been rejected by the Elks Lodge twice.
I'm not gonna say by who.
It was me.
Really? I told them that he's a pedophile.
- No.
- Yeah, he's not.
He's not a pedophile.
- He's not.
- Wait, Bob.
This check can't be right.
This is lower than the amount I spent on gas to get here.
Nothing wrong with the check, Frances.
That's your base salary.
That's what it's gonna stay until you sell a car and get a commission.
One week left in the month.
You sell a car, or you may be out on your keister.
Yeah, yeah, I But, listen I mean, my keister's having a little cash-flow problem right now.
I may not have sold a car yet, but I've come real close.
You see that buck up there? He came real close to not being hit by a bullet.
You see what I'm saying? Did you ever get a new driver's license? We gotta post them, and that old one didn't look a thing like you.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that's you.
I see myself as kind of a matchmaker for people and vehicles.
I have a feeling about you and this little cutie.
Why don't we take it for a test drive? MAN [OVER PA.]
: Frankie, you have a call on line one.
Your son's school is on line one.
Hurt or just in trouble? Because if it's just in trouble, can you ask them if I can call them back? [MAN SIGHS OVER PA.]
Yeah, this is Frankie Heck.
Is everything okay? - You said you were gonna pick him up.
- No, you said you were.
- I even put a Post-it on your thermos.
- That what that means? MAN [OVER PA.]
: There's birthday cake in the break room.
Angel food.
Feel that? Take a left right here.
Pretty smooth, huh? That's 150 horsepower.
Did I tell you about our recession deals? Oh, get in the right lane and pull over, pull over, pull over.
Brick.
Brick, get in, get in, get in.
Brick, how do you like those seats? They're amazing.
They also come with optional leather trim and Preferred Suede inserts.
If you buy today, I'll throw the inserts in for free.
Mom, are you crazy? That's a $600 value.
- At least you're still my hero.
- Oh, thanks, pal.
I made dinner! MIKE: Thank you.
FRANKIE: Sure.
Hey, underpants.
You think you're too good for us? We are a family, and we are going to eat together as a family.
[MUSIC PLAYING ON TV.]
MAN [ON TV.]
: This is Dancing with the Stars.
[MUTES TV.]
FRANKIE: Okay, let's hear about everybody's day.
Mine sucked.
Next.
Well, I'm trying to decide what number I should do for my show-choir audition.
AXL: Oh, my God.
SUE: What? Does it matter what song you pick? - There's no way you'll make it.
- Mom? - Mike.
- Axl.
Your brother's trying to say, choose what you want.
Me, I like a quick song.
Quick.
Leave them wanting more.
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.
You have a meeting with my teacher Monday.
- What? - It's imperative that you both be there.
[WHISPERING.]
Imperative.
Who's he whispering to? I thought I told you to knock that off.
[IN NORMAL TONE.]
I like it.
It soothes me.
Okay, what teacher's meeting? I didn't even get a note.
My God, you're so weird.
- Mom.
- Mike.
- Axl.
- Well, from what I can tell, it is Monday.
- Okay, we both work Monday.
- Sorry.
[WHISPERING.]
Sorry.
[IN NORMAL TONE.]
Sorry.
MIKE: Did I tell you Hank at the quarry found his finger today? FRANKIE: Oh, really? That's good.
SUE: Mom, Dad.
Are you guys disappointed in me, because I never make anything? Sure, I'm disappointed.
This is the 12th thing you've tried out for.
I love not having to go to the events.
I'm thinking maybe I won't try out for show choir if you guys don't think I should.
Of course she shouldn't.
Show choir in Indiana has always been huge.
Next to basketball, its combination of singing and Broadway-caliber choreography is the most cutthroat competition around.
I didn't wanna see her get hurt.
But then I looked at her young and shiny face not beaten down yet by busted dryers and mean bosses with guns.
- Go for it.
- Hm? - You really think so? - No.
Dad? This could be your year.
Okay.
Cool.
We are so screwed.
Brick is a very quirky child.
Maybe clinically quirky, even.
We have no idea what you mean.
We knew exactly what she meant.
[WHISTLING.]
[SINGING.]
Happy birthday to you Mrs.
Rettig.
Mrs.
Rettig, I wanna tell you something funny I did the other day.
Well, that may be because you haven't spent much time here in the classroom.
Are we supposed to? I mean, isn't that the point of school? Between 8 and 3, he's your problem? If he eats his napkin at dinner, we don't call you, ask you to come over.
Look, I would love to spend more time here.
But I work.
I'm at work right now.
Brick's a very bright boy, but we feel he could benefit from a series of formal tests FRANKIE: Look.
Brick isn't your typical kid but he is funny and sweet and probably a genius.
He doesn't fit in your cookie-cutter mold.
That doesn't mean that he needs fixing.
Our oldest son had a completely pointed head until he was 6.
Like a candy corn.
We got funny looks when we took him to the mall.
You know what we did? Nothing.
And eventually it flattened out all on its own.
We're trying to say here, thanks for your concern but our Brick doesn't need any special anything.
He's fine.
Mm-hm.
His best friend is his backpack.
I hope he's weird enough that our insurance covers it.
How happy are you with your car? First a busted dryer, now a busted kid.
I needed to sell a car now more than ever.
And if Ehlert caught me sneaking in and out, he'd nail my keister to his wall.
Well, Mr.
Ehlert was looking for you, Frankie.
- Where you been? - Here.
Right here.
Just working with this fine woman, who is interested in this fine car.
- Actually, I am interested in this car.
- Get out of town.
But I was just wondering if a convertible's too wild for me.
Are you kidding me? Wild on the outside but dependable on the inside.
Yeah, you know what? I consider myself a matchmaker MAN [OVER PA.]
: Frankie, call on line one.
- For people and vehicles.
- It's your husband.
- And you look like the type of person - Sounds pretty mad.
He's at Axl's school.
He needs you to go back and pick up Brick.
Oh, come on.
No, he is supposed to pick up Brick.
Axl is at football until 5:00.
Tell him to read his damn thermos.
- Look, I can come back another day.
- No.
No, I'm a mom too.
I know what it's like.
All sales personnel, the doughnuts are here.
You're suspended for three games? What's the matter with you? - What did he do? - Called his coach a moron.
- You always call him a moron.
- He called for a bomb on fourth and one.
Think you're a big shot just because you play ball? The smart-mouth attitude goes today.
- Whatever.
- That's it.
Go to your room.
Wait, you like your room.
Go to Sue's room.
- Moron.
- Damn it.
If only he had a car, a TV or a cell phone, something we could take away from him.
- I know.
- Mom, you're my hero.
That's nice, but we're trying to think up a punishment.
You'll need a costume.
[WHISPERING.]
Costume.
FRANKIE: Huh? [IN NORMAL TONE.]
I'm doing a book report on Superwoman.
Come dressed like her Monday, so I can show-and-tell you as part of my project.
You can also come as Jungle Girl, but I'd have to know today.
Damn it, Brick, you gotta tell me these things earlier.
I did.
I've been telling you all week, you're my hero.
Didn't you listen? Whatever.
Honey, okay, listen, I'm sorry.
Honey, come back here.
- Oh, let him be.
- What is happening? I used to think I was a pretty good mom, and now, God, I really I don't know.
Hey, come on, you're a great mom.
So Brick is weird, and Sue has no recognizable talent and Axl is flushing his future down the toilet.
- All kids are screwed up.
- Not the Donahues across the street.
- No, those kids are awesome.
- I know.
I did it.
I made show choir.
- You did? - Yeah.
You sure, honey? Is it actually written down somewhere? Yes.
Yes.
And they already rotated me in so I gotta learn everything quick for our competition this Friday.
Oh, my God! God, that's huge! Oh, honey, that's great.
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks, Dad.
Well, I better get my homework done, because I am going to be so busy.
[SQUEALING.]
[CHEERING.]
Either Sue does have some talent or we have one crappy show choir.
This called for a celebration.
Sue, I'm just so proud of you.
I never thought you'd make anything.
- Here's a dollar.
- Thank you.
Hey, come on, everybody.
It's getting kind of cold.
We should all get inside, eat together as a family.
Move that bus! Ohhh.

Plying her with snow cones.
She can't hold out.
She's on her second grape.

I'm just stretched so thin, I feel like I can't do anything right.
Oh, I know.
Some days, I just feel like getting in the car and driving - Yeah.

- Hey! - Sorry! I got three kids in jail! What? No, wait.
You're not gonna get away with this! I've got your license back at the office.

Yeah, the picture was too good.
Somebody call for a ride? Rough day? That's the thing about family.
Oh, sure, they eat your food and wreck your face you gotta save them a thousand times a day from God knows what but every now and then, they save you.
Not very fast for a superhero.
BRICK: Hi, Mom.
SUE: Are you okay? AXL: Nice tights.

Look at your mom.
Mom, don't worry about dinner.
We made it.
Oh You make it just like I do.
- I love you guys, you know.
- We know, Mom.
Mike, how come you never tell me you love me? I told you I loved you the day I married you.
If anything had changed, I'd let you know.
So, yeah, back then on the old license I didn't know what my life was gonna be.
And Mike's right.
Now I know.
This is my life.
It's not gonna be in People magazine or anything, but you know what? I got it good.

Wait, who am I yelling at again?",success
34,30 Rock,"Excuse me.
There's a line, buddy.
There's two lines.
No, no, there's one line.
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
What, you think there's two lines and we're all in this line-- you're the only genius that got in the other line? Can you believe this guy? Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
Hey, shut up.
What do you want on yours, baby? I want all the hot dogs, please.
Yeah, I'm--I'm buying all the hot dogs.
Oh, come on, lady.
And I'm giving them to the good people.
Who's that? Kicking it down the street Causin' a stir.
Who's that? I know that you're wondrin' That's her That's her, that's her, that's her, that's her.
Who's got the kind of charisma that The boys prefer.
Who's hot and you know that she knows it.
That's her.
She's like a summer sky.
It's like some cherry pie.
And there is butterfly.
Me oh my.
Who flaunts her feminine magic.
That's her That's me! That's Pam! The overly-confident morbidly obese woman.
This fat suit smells like corn chips.
Going again, please.
Thank you.
And this is the set of The Girlie Show.
It's a real fun ladies' comedy show for ladies.
Hey, everybody.
Look, here's someone you never get a chance to meet.
It's the head writer of The Girlie Show, Liz Lemon! The Girlie Show.
Hold on, I'll connect you.
- Hey.
- What's up? Hey, have you looked at that Cat Lady sketch? It's still seven minutes long.
Yikes, okay.
Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit.
But why? Apparently you can't say he's got a vagina.
Oh, it's--fine, I'll just take the whole thing out.
Hey, you gotta tell that NBC page to take it down a notch.
Oh, you mean Ken? Yeah, he just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group.
I'll talk to him.
What is this? Ah, well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules? Yes, I do.
Well, I just spent Atta boy.
Chumley.
The beverage situation around here is reprehensible.
Oh, good morning, sunshine.
Surely our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee.
Yeah, or like a big coffee dispenser.
That's what a samovar is.
Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel? Uh, Cerie, do you wanna get some coffee? No, thank you.
No? Hey, Josh.
I need to change your Michael Jackson thing.
Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Check it out.
So, uh, President Bush is in the news again.
Have you heard about this? No, Jay Leno.
The host of the Tonight Show.
I thought that's what I was doing.
So, uh, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars.
You know? No, no.
Like Jay Leno.
Like, ""Hey, here are the headlines.
"" You ever--you ever notice when you eat a lot of cheese, and you-- How is that different from what I was doing, though? And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
I agree.
I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not.
Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy.
I promise I'll do better, Mr.
Hornberger.
Sure you will.
I just-- I just love television so much.
We all do.
Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor.
Who, Gary? Tell him I'll be up in half an hour.
No, they said now.
If they got cookies up there, grab some.
Ooh, and get them to pay for my Samovar.
Of course, I mean, I assume that's what we're meeting about.
What about, uh, Ray Romano? Can you do Ray? Hey.
God, oh.
Debra.
There you go.
My brother's tall.
Right? Are we in trouble or something? No way.
Gary loves the show.
Pleased with the ratings.
Right.
Of course.
They love us.
Where's Gary? Gary's dead.
I'm Jack Donaghy.
New VP of development for NBC/GE/Universal/Kmart.
Oh, we own Kmart now.
No.
So why are you dressed like we do? I'm surprised you're renovating.
This is such a nice office.
It's a great office, but sometimes, you have to change things that are perfectly good just to, uh, make them your own.
Please.
Ah, I'll call her back.
Is she at the White House line? Great.
Tell them I need a 4:00 a.
m.
tee off time.
Uh, five inches, but it's thick.
Are you familiar with the GE Tri-vection Oven? I don't cook very much.
Sure, I got you.
New York, third wave feminist, college educated.
Single and pretending to be happy about it.
Overscheduled, undersexed, you buy any magazine that says ""Healthy body image"" on the cover.
And every two years, you take up knitting for A week.
That is dead on! What, are you gonna guess my weight now? You don't want me to do that.
That knitting thing is uncanny.
How do you do that? Market research, my friend.
Years and years of market research, which lead to my greatest triumph.
The Tri-vection oven.
Oh, my wife wants one of those.
Could we get Pete an oven, please? Hey.
The GE Tri-vection oven cooks perfect food five times faster than a conventional oven, because it uses three kinds of heat.
Thermal technology for consistent temperature.
GE Precise Air convection technology for optimal air circulation, and microwave technology for incredible speed.
With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey in 22 minutes.
Wow.
That is impressive.
The people upstairs think so.
That's why they promoted me.
That's why they sent me here to retool your show.
Retool what now? I'm the new vice president of east coast television and microwave oven programming.
That sounds like you program microwave ovens.
I like you.
You have the boldness of a much younger woman.
Lee, does my face look bloated to you? When I played that lady rapist on Law & Order, guess what the makeup guy put on under my eyes to take the puffiness out? Hemorrhoid cream.
Ms.
Maroney? I have the cat wrangler here for you.
Oh, is it that horrible little--Hi.
Hey.
Greta Johannsen.
It's short for ""LaGreta.
"" Hi, great to see you again.
You too.
I'm here to introduce you to feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
Okay.
This is Po-Po.
And this here is Captain Boots.
Hello.
Uh, would you describe yourself as ""cat competent?"" Oh, yes.
I love cats.
I used to have two cats.
But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors, so we had to put them down.
I'm joking.
I've done several focus groups, on this show, and what I've gleaned-- The blonde, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays.
Jenna, that's my friend Jenna.
And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49.
I'm not missing them, they're just not there.
I think I can fix that.
So your job is, you take things that are already working, and you fix them.
That's a great job.
Okay, let's-- Why don't we, um-- You're missing that third kind of heat.
I want you to think about Tracy Jordan.
Okay--the black guy? The black movie star.
I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining.
Isn't he, um crazy? Tracy's had his problems in the last few years.
I am a Jedi! I am a Jedi! I am a Jedi! The important thing to remember is, he was never charged with a crime.
It's not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbor's roof.
Nor should it be.
Tracy Jordan is the third heat.
I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.
I think I do.
What are you doing? Sometimes when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it.
""This is not a dream.
"" Tracy Jordan is in New York today, Liz.
I'd like you to have lunch with him.
We have a show tonight, Mr.
Donaghy.
I don't know if your research covered this, but we do a dress rehearsal, and then a live show.
That's tonight.
This is lunch.
If it's not a good fit, I'll drop the whole thing.
If I meet with Tracy Jordan, and we mutually agree that this is the worst idea ever, you'll back off? I'm known for being reasonable.
Okay.
Alfredo, 2:00 p.
m.
I'm not dressed for that.
You're dressed for Burger King.
Should we make it Burger King? Pete, hang back for me.
Yeah, you bet.
Hey.
What happened to your head? Uh, the sky is falling.
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow? Thank you, Lee.
Whatever.
Hey, you know in that Cat Lady sketch? Do I have to hold a real cat? Cat Lady sketch? That thing's gonna get cut.
Oh, good.
Who's that? That is the new network dude.
Mmm, yummers.
He reminds me of Scotty on General Hospital.
What? No, ew, Jenna.
Do not like that man.
That is a bad man.
God, you have a gift.
Laura Bush is your size.
Hi, uh, what are you doing down here? I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
That's how you should dress for work, by the way.
Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines.
Afghanistan is a different situation I'll have an apple juice.
Oh, we don't have apple juice, sir.
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon.
I know who you are.
I thought there was a strict dress code at this place.
I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli.
They're very subtle.
So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show.
And I don't know how you feel about that-- Lemme ask you a question.
Everybody at this table.
Did he just say the word ""pumpkin"" to me? Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli.
Yo! I'm buggin'.
I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.
I can't eat here.
I got to go someplace where they make food that I like.
Lemon, let's go.
I will not work with Tracy Jordan.
It's just a rumor.
Have you seen any of his movies? The guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters.
Yeah, Black Cop/White Cop.
No.
Who Dat Ninja? No, he-- He had to pretend to be this old lady Ooh, ooh, ooh! Goodness gracious! You hooligans better watch out.
'Cause this honky grandma be trippin'! Oh, yeah.
That movie was hilarious.
I saw it like five times.
Where's the love? Right on, let me get two apple chickens and some pecan waffles.
Nothing for me, I-- I had, like, four hot dogs this morning.
Eat, Lemon.
Eat! I hate skinny women.
Hey, Lorna.
Ten beers.
So, Tracy, we should talk about the show.
Yeah, I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way.
You know, I want it to be raw.
HBO-style content.
Well, it's not HBO.
It's TV.
And I don't think that it's a good fit-- You know, cause I wanna drop truth bombs.
You know how pissed off I was when Us Weekly said that I was on crack? That's racism.
I'm not on crack.
I'm straight up mentally ill! Sure.
I got mental health issues.
Sure, well, you know Who doesn't, really? Hey, has anyone seen Liz? Or Pete? She went out.
Well, who's in charge when they're not here? I'm in charge.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume.
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
I'm Jenna, by the way.
Ms.
Moroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted.
It's for my face.
Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working.
You know, I don't-- I don't think you'd like it.
'Cause we work a lot of hours, and it's live TV, which is risky.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I like risky.
See, me and you, we play the game.
We know how to be acceptable.
Hello, great meeting.
I drink coffee, please.
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes? All of 'em.
Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe.
Karl Robe, you say? Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other.
To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets.
That's a metaphor.
Sure.
You should tell that to Us Weekly.
Hey, Lemon.
You like karaoke? I know a joint.
No, no, I-- I gotta wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy.
I'll take you.
I'll take you.
I just gotta make a quick stop first.
You know what, when people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or the store.
No, thank you.
You know what, this is for computer classes.
Know why I should do this TV show, Lemon? I really don't.
To get you rich.
'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gon' blow up.
How do you know I'm not rich? Your teeth.
You got to think like these strippers, Lemon.
They know the window of opportunity's only open for a moment.
You gotta get in when you're young.
Get the money and get out.
Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy.
I don't have sex for a living.
Neither do we.
Neither do they.
Yes, they do.
Where is my phone? We are strong No one can tell us we're wrong Searching our hearts for so lo-ong He's got charisma.
No, that's Charisma over there.
Girlie Show.
Ken, send me a car, okay? What is your location? Dark Sensations, in the Bronx.
I wish you were here.
Mr.
Donaghy does not get us showbiz people.
Let me talk to Pete, okay? Oh, Pete got fired this morning.
That's so weird that you don't know that.
Jack Donaghy thinks he's gonna come into my house and mess with my show? Hell no.
Jenna and I worked for years to get this show.
You know, I moved from Chicago for this.
From Chicago? I was in Scottie Pippen's wedding.
Now Donaghy is trying to steal it from us.
He already fired Pete, who is a great producer.
He fired Pete? He can't fire Pete.
You know what, I quit.
He can suck it.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, suck it, Pete.
No, you're not listening.
You're not a good listener.
But Liz said we were cutting the cat lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
Ouch.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.
I just don't think that I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it? I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
What--what do you mean? Who's everybody? The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye-- You mean this eye? Okay, this eye-- It doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it.
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What? Where is Liz? Liz?! Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.
Is Liz back yet? No, which cat do you want Jenna to carry? I'm sorry? Which cat? Oh.
I wantthat one.
Jack Donaghy to the control room, please.
Jack Donaghy.
Peanut's not an actor.
I just--I just rescued him from a lab.
Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off.
Where do you live? The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
I want to tell Donaghey to his face that I quit.
And I want to do it in front of the whole crew, so that they know he didn't fire me.
I wanna see that.
Gonna turn the lights down low.
It's almost time for the Girlie Show Ooh, ooh, pull over.
Pull over here.
Tracy, I don't have time for this.
This is where I grew up.
This is the Jordan family estate? Wasn't no Jordan family nothin'.
This is where I was in foster care.
Oh.
Sorry.
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
It's not luck, I mean You got out of here because you're very talented, and people love you, and Are you peeing? Where's Donaghy? I wanna talk to him right now.
Last time I saw him, he was riding a crane camera.
Oh, I have Pete for you.
Pete, oh, my God.
I didn't know.
No, hey, listen.
It'll--it'll give me a chance to spend more time with my kids.
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.
No, no, no, no, no.
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
Don't buy all the hot dogs.
Okay? I don't want to do this without you.
Hey, I thought we cut the Cat Lady sketch.
We're two minutes short! So, let me introduce myself.
My name is Lurleen Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat? I cast that cat myself.
And sir, while they are my-- Ow! Aaugh! No, no, no, no, no.
He's okay.
I need you to talk for two minutes.
About what? Anything.
All right.
These cats are more than just pets, sir.
Why, just this morning-- Excuse me! Where is the manager? I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets.
Uh-oh.
Look at Shorty.
This honky grandma be trippin'.
What's up, America? I'm coming into your house live.
Lemme hear you say ""We love you, Tracy.
"" We love you, Tracy! I am the third heat! He's brilliant.
Are you drunk? Yes.
Why did you fire Pete? Why did you disappear all night? Is this some kind of a power play? Yeah, yeah.
It's not so fun being ""hands on"" with these bloodsuckers, is it? Could we talk about this on Monday? No.
I want Pete back.
I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe, and I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room.
Fine.
I thought you were going to quit.
Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me.
You weigh 127 pounds.
Yeah.
Thank you, good night.
You will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer.
Good night, sleep tight.

You'll know it when you see it.
Thanks for the heads-up, Tre.
No problem just do me a favor.
Try not to make eye contact with any members, when you're holding the plunger.
Really bums 'em out.
Well, I mean, what if someone just, like, walks Underwater massage? Yes yes, that sounds intense.
Great job, killing it.
Who's got more deals? Who else has a deal for me? Ooh, Nicole, what's your deal.
I'm kind of obsessed with these D-I-Y vajazzling seminars and I feel like they'd be a really great fit for us.
That is what I'm talking about.
Do you guys smell that? Come on, sniff the air.
Oh, what's that odor? I think it's the scent of a deal.
Who's got more deals for me? Ooh, in the back, Ilana.
Dope sweatshirt what is your deal? I've been kind of obsessed with getting paid, and I was wondering if that's happening today, so we could all be paid.
Checks, unfortunately, delayed 'til Friday.
Bummer.
F-M-L, right? Speaking of F-M-L, went on a third date.
with that girl from Match.

Let's get back to our desks.
Deals don't make themselves.
Bonjour, petit Wayne.
I am a genius.

That's how much of a dealer you are.
Ilana.
Ooh.
Come on, this is not work.
Oh okay, I'll take lunch.
Please Come back today.
Oh! Ilana.

Oh, really? Okay, listen I really think that you deserve hey.
Sorry, I forgot about the line.
I'll see you in the second-class citizen area.
It's called the non-member pen and you know that.
Ew listen to yourself.
I think you deserve like an Abbi Bueller's day off.
I can't just leave work in the middle of the day.
Yes, you can you just lie, and leave.
All they let you do, is fold towels, anyway.
No, they don't.
They let me do a lot more than that.
I wash the towels, and then I dry the towels.
Great to see you.
Good friend? Uh-huh, yeah, she's great.
Also, any day now, a trainer's gonna be absent, and guess who they're gonna invite, to instruct a class.
I would love for that to happen, but it's just not.
They don't respect you.
Oh, thank God, Abbi, there you are.
Tre.
Thank God.
We really need you, buddy.
Yes, I'm prepared.
So We got another pube situation, in the women's locker room.
Yeah somebody really went to town, in the second shower stall.
And if you need the snake, it's probably wherever you last left it.

Okay, Abbi, come on.

I labeled it pretty clearly.
Mm-hmm, I see.
Maybe in the future if you do that, put it on, like Like, all six sides of the cheese brick.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you can just restock it, then? I can put on some sweats, and run out if you want me to.
Yeah, okay.
Or, you know I'm not talking to you! I'm talking to my roommate! You're not my roommate.
You're my roommate's boyfriend.

My bad.
You know, I think I'm lactose intolerant.
Good thing you ate all that cheese.
You know that, there's a plunger in the bathroom.
It's right next to the toilet.
It's like, right within I do know that, but I also know that you told me, not to touch your stuff in the bathroom.
Right.
That's my mistake.
Yeah.
You disgust me.
What? Oh Sergeant First Class! I just ranked up, Abbi! Yes, I placed the Jewess ad.

Huge dent.
Did you call me? No, Matt, I didn't call you! It's like, why would we call you? It's like he's constantly in my face.
It kills me that he lives here, and doesn't pay a cent.
I feel dirtier when I leave the shower, because his hair His hair is, like, all over my body.
It's like I have to see your dick in your shorts.
God! You know, one side is always gonna be hamstrung, by the other side's congress, you know? It just doesn't matter we're done.
We're done as a country.

That's why I'm hanging back.
That's cool.
I respect you, respecting me.
Yeah? I'm gonna respect your dick later.
Yeah! Weekdays are tough.
It's early for lunch.
They just need time to find the audience, you know? The first season of ""Seinfeld,"" not that many people saw that show, but it got time to grow.
Yeah.
Oh, we got a fan.
We got a fan, hey, hey, hey.
Me and Ilana, we really don't like to use labels.
We try to be more progressive.
We have a real connection.
Oh, she's break dancing, that's cool.
All right, let's pick it up.
Who teaches the bucket drummers? I never seen a bucket drummer class listed anywhere.
She should be giving us, like, 25%.
We can't do this anymore.
This is insane.
We're like where'd the music go? Boo! Are you kidding me? No she wouldn't even have anything to dance to, if it wasn't for us! You suck! What shut up! All right.
You come out, and you try to do some good.
Stop! Grow up! I just don't understand why she took the fishbowl.
I would have given it to her.
Homeless people need supplies, I don't know.
I know.
And we need 90 bucks in two hours and you need to get stoned, I need your 90 bucks okay.
Crazy brain, man.
You know what, Ilana, I rag on you all the time, but you're right, like, I needed to, get out of my element today.
Hello? I needed it.
It was nice of you to have my back Jesus.
Thank you for this opportunity.
We'll see you in 30 minutes or less.
Bye-bye, sir.
What? Okay, I had a backup plan on the low this whole time, and it's coming up, it's happening.
We are gonna make this money, and I'll buy you a new piggy bank, a legit piggy bank.
What is it? Come on.
Ilana, this is really good pot.
It's P.
C.
P.
What? Okay.
I'm gonna start taking my clothes off now.
Wait, what? Yeah.
This is all part of the deal.

What would you be doing instead? Watching ""Breaking Bad"" and eating a Smart Ones? Okay, it's a cashew stir-fry, and I was, like, really looking forward to it.
I don't want to hear it, okay.
You're losing your edge, and I wasn't gonna say anything, but you're not as fun as you used to be.
Guess I'll clean this dude's apartment on my own.
Yeah Mack I'm gonna a millionaire I'm a young money millionaire tougher than Nigerian hair my criteria compared to your career just isn't fair I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed through the pencil I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind 'cause I don't write shit 'cause I ain't got time 'cause my seconds minutes hours go to the almighty dollar and the almighty Okay, hour's up, man.

Thank you for cleaning.

I can pay you in blocks? You're not a baby, you're a man! No.
I'm a baby.
Oh, yeah you're a baby? Does baby like this, huh? Babies do not read books yet! Are you a baby if you wear a hat? Full coat with fur? Babies don't have little babies! You want tissues to wipe your ass? 'Cause you're a baby? Coat racks aren't for babies.
Marbles.
Uh-oh.
What? Look.
I'm looking.
Yeah, we saw, dude.
I hope I never see this again.
I don't even know.
All right, all right, careful of the marbles.
So I'm gonna grab this, 'cause babies don't like fur.
Are you my fwends? No.
This is David.
Is the flight delayed? Was the flight delayed? Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah Lil Wayne's so short, though, that we weren't even gonna be able to see him, from where we would have sat.
I don't think I even would have recognized him.
I don't know who this guy is.
You know, I read that he's actually better, pre-recorded.
I just didn't want to say anything, 'cause I wanted to go.
These spaces are so small, like, we would be so close, to so many strangers we don't know.
Drinks are, like, so expensive, and tiny, like Oh, my God, double crap.
Do you know me, how I have to pee, like, constantly? We would be standing in line the whole concert.
The whole time, we would be standing in a line.
Ugh.
Tomorrow's gonna be the day, like, I know it, that we're gonna look back, and be like, that was the day! I know that tomorrow tomorrow's totally the day.
Like, I'm so confident in myself, I feel it in my heart.
I'm confident myself in the day.
Yes yeah! I believe in us.
Hyah yeah! Yes, dude! Dude, I would follow you into hell, brother.
I would take you on my shoulders, like, I'd strap you up, and I'd be like, let's go through hell.
Should we go to mm-hmm.
The subway.
We'll give you some privacy.
Enjoy your office supplies, my friend.
They even have food now.
Crazy, right? Okay okay, cha-cha.
Good.
Ah.
Please.
Help me.
Ay, mi amor, what happened to you? Oh, yeah.
What the hell what is this? Oh, it's happening.
Why are we doing this right now? Hymes, you can go.
She got me.
I don't got her I'm not there with you.
Leave me one, leave me one.
Okay.
Ilana, we drank the same amount.
I'm so sorry.
I always do this.
It's fine, everyone has nights like this.
Just, if you feel like you're gonna throw up, just give me a heads up.
You wanna come over and hang out? We just got pizza.
What kind?",success
36,Scrubs,"I've always been able to sleep through anything.
Storms, sirens, you name it.
Last night, I didn't sleep.
I guess I get a little goofy when I'm nervous.
You see, today isn't just any other day.
It's my first day.
I'm the man.
Three years of pre-med and four years of med school have made me realise one thing Could you drop an NG tube on the patient in 234 and then call the attending? I don't know Jack.
So this is my story.
- I'm supposed to be in intensive care.
- We just turfed him there.
I became a doctor to help people, but orientation yesterday didn't really focus on patient care.
The hospital doesn't wanna be sued.
Being sued is not a good thing.
- Hey, Turk? - What's up? You know how I'm down with the rap music? Dude, be whiter.
Chris Turk's my best friend.
We roomed together in college and med school.
We even got accepted by the same hospital.
Here's the thing.
Tupac, DMX, Dr Dre in most of their songs, they use an extremely volatile racial slur.
- The ""N"" word.
- I got it.
My question is this: if we're both singing along and I would never use the word otherwise - Am I allowed to say - No.
That's good for me to know.
Finally, doctors, if there is a mistake, don't admit it to the patient.
Of course, if the patient is deceased, and you're sure you can feel free to tell him or her anything.
I found us an apartment.
OK, gang, I'm Dr Bob Kelso, and I'm your Chief of Medicine so I just want to encourage you all to think of me as your safety net.
Because I promise you, we're a family here.
Now, then, go get 'em, doctors.
The surgical interns are gonna go grab a beer.
The medical interns are having a Pac-Man tournament.
We're all twelve.
I love Pac-Man.
Me, too.
I love watching it, I love playing it, I love all of it.
- I'm Elliot.
- Ell-i-ot.
Don't do that.
I'm JD.
This is Turk.
Are you medical or surgical? Medical.
Hello.
Every male in my family is a doctor.
That's why Dad gave me a guy's name made me play sports, date girls.
Joking.
I know.
I would've laughed if you'd paused.
I know what you're thinking.
Your butt looks like two Pringles hugging.
- No, you don't.
- I'm Miss ""Hyper-Competitive.
"" It used to be a big problem for me.
Used to.
Past tense.
Are we racing? Yes! I'm not that desperate.
No! You do a lot of cardio? Oh, yes.
Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great.
One, I am your resident, Dr Jeffrey Steadman.
Not ""Jeff'.
Two, here are your manuals.
Notice how quickly people make an impression? I am a tool.
I am a tool.
I am a tool, tool, tool.
- An unbelievably annoying tool.
- Yeah.
These are your beepers.
From now on, they control your life.
Thanks.
Move it.
Back to today.
- I was paged.
- First day, Bambi? Don't look at me when we're moving someone.
Why? - We're waiting for Dr Cox.
- Hi, doctor - Place an IV for me.
- We'll talk later.
Carla, do you spray the perfume on or fill your bathtub up - And splash around in it? - I smell nice.
You've done this to cadavers.
He's alive.
Poke it through his skin.
Now! Time's up.
Carla, will you do it for him? - Why tell her? - Shut up and watch.
Be nice to Bambi.
Why's he got to try and die every day during my lunch? That's insensitive.
Mistake.
Man's 92, has dementia, doesn't know we're here.
He is inches from Carla's rack and hasn't flinched.
- That is so sweet.
- Yeah, it is.
What about his subconscious? Eisenhower was a sissy.
I think we're gonna be OK.
From now on, whenever I'm in the room you're definitely not allowed to talk.
Dr Dorian, can you tell me what ailment most often Rounds is like being on a game show.
What is uraemia? That's my boy.
Nice clean job on the Foley catheter.
I had a nurse do it.
I'm still afraid to touch anybody.
I've been thinking a lot about Elliot.
A whole lot.
Dr Reid, you're late.
I got puked on.
You're off the hook if you can tell me what to look for in a uraemic patient.
Anyway, I'm going for it.
- Infection.
- Infection? That's my girl.
Moving on.
- I knew the answer.
- I'm sure you did.
- I'm just frazzled.
- How could you not be? If there's anything I can do for you You could let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.
Around seven? Or eight? Why not? Nice! ""Why not?"" That's what she said.
""Why not?"" Daddy, why did you marry Mommy? Tiger, I gave her an answer during rounds and she screwed my brains out.
You're the man.
What the hell are you doing? Did you actually just page me to find out how much Tylenol to give to Mrs Lenzer? I was worried it could exacerbate It's regular-strength Tylenol.
Here's what you do.
Open her mouth, take a handful and throw it at her.
Whatever sticks, that's the correct dosage.
Under no circumstances are you to compromise our no-talking agreement.
Dr Kelso is always saying I'm gonna say this as carefully as possible so I don't overstate it.
Dr Kelso is the most evil human being on the planet and may in fact be Satan himself.
It's just that this isn't what I expected.
Most of my patients are older and sorta checked-out, mentally.
Pumpkin, that's modern medicine.
Advances that keep people alive who should've died a long time ago.
Back when they lost what made them people.
Your job is to stay sane enough so when someone does come in that you can help you're not so braindead you can't function.
For the love of God, what? Should we be talking about this in front of Her? She's dead.
Write this down.
If you push around a stiff nobody'll ask you to do anything.
You've been like a father to me.
If they find out nurses are doing your procedures you'll be kicked out so quick, your head'll spin.
And there it is.
Have a terrific day.
I'm not really dead.
Bambi, here's Mrs Lenzer's tox screen.
Is Turk having the same experience I am? - I am such a stud.
- Probably not.
I had my hands inside of a guy's chest.
I couldn't even see them.
I should not be allowed to do stuff like that.
Wassup? - You weren't scared? - One way or another everyone stops bleeding.
- That is so deep.
- No, it isn't.
It's a little deep.
- About the apartment - T-Man! Word up, boy, how you doing? - All right.
- Todd, JD.
- JD, this is my man Todd.
- What's goin' I was back in high school.
Surgical interns are all slice 'em and dice 'em.
Medical interns are trained to think about the body.
Diagnose, test.
Medical interns You got a stain.
we're the chess club.
I just have bad gas.
What are you testing me for? To see if your gas could be harmful to others.
He's just scared.
Talk to him.
Look, Mr Burski, I heard a systolic murmur in your heart which is most likely nothing, but if I don't check you out - I'll worry about you all day.
- Then I'll do it.
For you.
You're a good man.
I'm waiting for someone.
The door is broke.
Probably the fifth time or so it don't open.
Maybe a penny's stuck in there.
- Why a penny? - I don't know.
- Did you stick a penny in there? - No, I was making small talk.
If I find a penny in there, I'm taking you down.
Welcome to rounds, kids.
Elliot is the only thing keeping me from losing my mind.
She is my dream girl.
The necrosis and infected stool most likely indicate what, Dr Dorian? I don't know.
Sir, I have no idea.
Dr Reid, can you help him out? Superior mesenteric insufficiency.
That's my girl.
Patient number two.
""Superior mesenteric "" Draining stomach fluid will get my spirits up.
- Circles for you.
- Shut up and do it.
Fantastic.
Now just suck out the fluid with the giant needle.
Needle's too big.
I'm gonna get a nurse.
Come on, man.
Learn by doing.
Why couldn't I do that? I hated him at that moment.
OK, maybe the needle was a little too big.
- You think? - What's going on? Nothing.
This is totally normal.
So are you gonna move your stuff in? That's why I came by.
I think it's better if we both branched out.
Tell him that's stupid.
Tell him you need him.
I feel the same way.
What's it like being a young hotshot doctor? Did you ever go see a movie everyone told you was great and because of all the expectations, you were disappointed? Movies nowadays have too many special effects.
That was my point.
My first code.
Someone's heart fails, they beep everyone.
The first doctor in has to run the room decides if a patient lives or dies.
What, am I crazy? You chicken.
Don't worry.
Turk was there, ""learning by doing"".
- Charged.
- Clear.
The guy was just sleeping, attached to a faulty monitor.
I thought we cared for each other.
You just wanna sleep with me.
I don't wanna sleep with you now.
Do me right here.
See? Right.
Pass me a trach kit.
Thanks.
Our date is totally cancelled.
I was sitting on the floor for two reasons.
One, I tried to lock Elliot in that supply closet and she kicked me.
Hard.
And two, the on-call room was locked.
Come on, I got ten minutes to sleep.
Wait.
Tell me if I'm going too fast, OK? Lose the clothes.
I heard Turk was gonna move in with Todd.
I'm surprised that freak isn't in there with him.
Damn, this is hot.
Nice.
Your turn.
No, I gotta get back, but very nice.
Hey, Bambi.
I'll call you, OK? Give me a big ""ahh"".
A big-boy ""ahh"".
Turk almost had sex in the on-call room.
You realise, of course, I have no idea who Turk is but good for him.
You see, Billy, it turns out that sex is life-affirming.
What do you say? Got a urine sample for me? I just did five minutes ago.
But here's the thing.
Take this, put it on the ground, close your eyes and go nuts.
What do you say? - Cool! - Attaboy.
Go get 'em.
- Why are you here? - Seems like a good kid.
You're worried about being on call tonight.
Yeah.
Look, worst-case scenario you kill somebody and it's with you the rest of your life.
But that is the absolute worst-case scenario.
Just have the nurses do the stuff you're too chicken to do which is everything, and if you have a really rough admission Call you? No! Hide in the closet again.
This is fun.
- Nurse? - I'm a doctor.
The stethoscope, the beeper, a doctor, got it? Relax.
I hate the ""darlings"", the ""sweethearts"".
No need to tell me how hard it is being a woman here.
You're helping by wearing a thong and hooking up in the on-call room.
Word gets around.
You talk like that, do you even know my name? I spend every second of my life either here or taking care of my mom so, yeah, maybe I needed a little closeness.
You never had a quickie at the club, right? Or snuck some skinny college boy up to your sorority room.
And my thong? I think it makes my ass look good.
And some days, I need to feel good about something.
And you judge me? Well, guess what? Word does get around, Ms Out-For-Herself.
So you can dump on everyone here if you want, but you will not hurt me.
Her name's Carla, by the way.
Hey, champ.
First night on call starts soon, huh? You must be excited.
You betcha.
About Mrs Pratt.
I heard you wanted to put her on the hospital's transplant list.
I'd recommend keeping her on dialysis a little longer.
- Maybe we'll get lucky.
- No problem, sir.
Great.
Have a ball.
On call.
Little poem for ya.
Bambi, let's go.
I'll check on you every ten minutes, Mrs Marino, OK? I need to see you in Mr Burski's room.
Are you flirting with me? You are, aren't you? He crashed.
The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.
No way anyone could've caught it.
- You have to pronounce him.
- Why didn't anybody page me? Could you just pronounce him so I can go home? I'll never forget that moment.
The way he looked exactly the same only completely different.
The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me.
Time of death 0200.
I just wanted to help people.
The hardest part is how quickly you have to move on.
Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.
I lied before.
I'm scared every second.
Really? It's a good thing they make surgical masks.
If they didn't everyone would know my face was like this the whole time.
I think it's OK to be scared.
I need you to tell me that.
He needs me? I just came to check up on you, see how you're doing.
Ask him to move in again.
Turk, the offer still stands I already took the keys out your bag.
I love you.
And like that, I got a second wind.
I'm watching you.
- How you holding up? - There he is.
My safety net.
I saw that you're still pushing to put Mrs Pratt on the transplant list.
Bad news, though.
She doesn't have the insurance to cover it.
But she's a second away from total renal failure.
OK Did you ask the Burski family for permission to do an autopsy? They're still with him.
It's a teaching hospital, you gotta ask.
Tell him you can't see Mr Burski again, he'll understand.
Sir, do you think I could skip just this one? Why, sure, sport.
See? Every story needs a good guy.
In fact, why don't you just head on home? You look kinda tired.
I am pretty tired.
Dr Dorian, do you not realise that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me? The only reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember your names.
If the patient has insurance, you treat them.
If they don't, you show them the door.
And if somebody dies, you get the autopsy.
Get it by rounds tomorrow or I'll scratch your name off my chart.
Clear? Answer me! Crystal clear.
Great, sport.
If he's the jerk then who's the good guy? Car accident.
Crashed on the way up.
Relieve the pressure on his chest.
JD, do it.
God, no.
Look at me.
You can do this.
- And I believed him.
- Chest tube tray.
You know, kind of.
Come on, baby, let's go.
You can do this.
You have to do this.
JD, cut him or lose him.
Give me the tube.
I can't get through the pleura.
Don't be gentle, get it in there.
Connect it, please, Carla.
- Normal rhythm.
- No way! It's a piece of cake.
It's your patient.
You're leaving? That's your patient, doctor.
Good.
- That's enough.
- Sorry.
It's a very big moment for me.
I guess that's it for now.
You finally off? Almost.
I have one more annoying thing I gotta do.
If it's the Burski autopsy, I called the family and they said fine, and to thank you, and I'm sorry.
They didn't say that last part, I did.
The worst part was knowing I could never forgive her.
I forgive her.
You see, I can't survive on my own.
I'm a dork.
A dork.
I'm a dork.
Even now, when I get to go home I'll know the hospital's still here, wide awake.
Get out while you still can.
But what the hell.
The important thing is I got through my first three days without looking like a complete idiot.
I'm the man.",success
37,Community,"Good morning.
How do we turn this off? Can you help me turn this off? Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
How do we turn this off? Can you help me with this? Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
I didn't mean to snap.
Good morning.
Many of you are halfway through your first week here at Greendale, and as your dean I thought I would share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration.
What is community college? Well, you've heard all kinds of things.
You've heard it's loser college for remedial teens, middle-aged divorcees, and old people keeping their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity.
That's what you've heard.
However, I wish you luck.
Okay, you know Uh-oh.
Okay, there's more to this speech.
There's actually a middle card that is missing.
Can we all look around our immediate areas? Because I really wanted to I'm only half Arabic, actually.
My dad is Palestinian.
He's a U.
S.
citizen, he's not a threat to national security or anything.
Lot of people want to know after they meet him because he has angry energy.
Not like angry at America, just angry at my mom for leaving.
Although she did leave because he was angry.
And he was angry because she's American.
My name's Abed, by the way.
Abed, nice to know you and then meet you, in that order.
Now about that question that I had? Oh, uh Five after 11 when you asked.
Abed.
Yeah.
What's the deal with the hot girl from Spanish class? I can't find a road in there.
Well, I only talked to her once while she was borrowing a pencil.
Her name is Britta, she's She has two older brothers.
One works with children who have a disorder I might wanna look up.
And she thinks she's gonna flunk tomorrow's test.
So she really needs to focus.
And she's sorry if that makes her seem cold.
Holy crap.
Abed, I see your value now.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Absolutely not.
If these guys knew you like I did, they would have given you a small office.
Jeff Winger, genius at law.
You gotta stop saying that.
I will never do that.
Sit down.
I still cannot figure out how you got a jury to connect September the 11 th with my DUI, let alone why that helped.
Well, 2002 was a simpler time.
So, what is my lawyer doing here? I'm a student.
Well, that cannot be an inspiring journey.
I am in a bit of a jam.
The state bar has suspended my license.
They found out my college degree was less than legitimate.
I thought you had a bachelor's from Columbia.
Now I have to get one from America.
Oof.
And it can't be an e-mail attachment.
Well, you've picked a fine school.
Yes.
And I'm hoping that our friendship will yield certain advantages.
You know, academic guidance.
Yes.
Moral support.
Every answer to every test for every one of the classes that I'm taking.
Here's my schedule.
Now, Jeff, just by asking that you have insulted the integrity of this entire institution.
Oi.
Waster.
Not a bathroom.
Not a bathroom.
Okay.
Duncan, you did seem less into integrity the day that I convinced that when you made that U-turn on the freeway and tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box that your only real crime was loving America.
Well, I do love America.
I love it very much.
Mm? L I love chalupas.
But I'll look into it.
Thank you.
Duncan, you are a good man.
Jeff, are you familiar with the adage ""Cheaters never prosper""? No.
And if I wanted to learn something, I wouldn't have come to community college.
Oh, hey, Spanish.
Yeah, don't hit on me, okay? Uh, I wouldn't dream of it.
I just wanted to let you know about my Spanish study group.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
The guy who's playing ""Bejeweled"" on his iPhone all class has a study group? Can I sign up twice? I'm taking the class as an easy credit.
I'm actually a Spanish tutor.
Board certified.
Can you say that in Spanish now? I really need help with Spanish.
Yeah, I was willing to bet.
I'm Jeff.
Or jefe.
The group meets at the library at 4.
Britta.
Thanks.
You're gonna be there? That means, ""See you there.
"" Shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group, right? Huh? Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.
I was raised on TV, and I was conditioned to believe that every black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor.
Were you conditioned to pay for your damn tacos, Seinfield? Yes.
I'm so sorry.
It's ""Seinfeld.
"" Hey, all right, come on in.
I've got the whole table.
Welcome.
Yeah, the whole room.
Here's the contact sheet.
Just put your stuff there.
That's Man, the rest of the group is running late.
But you and I can get acquainted.
You may have noticed this morning, not so good at the small talk.
Yeah, I like big talk.
What's your deal? That's not small talk? What's your deal and is God dead? All right, you wanna know my deal? Mm.
I dropped out of high school because I thought for some reason it would impress Radiohead.
You'd be surprised what gets back to those guys.
I joined the Peace Corps.
I did a little foot modeling.
I got tear gassed at a world trade rally Marry me.
Ha.
And I guess, Jeff, my deal is, above all else, honesty.
Honesty.
Yeah.
You tell me the truth, I will like you.
You lie to me, I will never talk to you again.
That's my deal.
That's a good deal.
So, what's your deal? Uh I would have to go I would have to say, um, honesty.
Because I would say anything to get what I want, and I want you to like me.
So Well, that's a very honest answer.
All right, for now, I like you fine.
Really? Wow.
You're easy.
Hell, yeah.
Abed.
In the house.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo.
Why? Britta invited me.
Is that cool? Oh, I can't think of a single logical reason why not.
Cool.
There you go.
Oh, hey, here.
Put your contact info down right there.
That's right.
Cool, cool, cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Hey, this is kind of like Breakfast Club, huh? We are in a library.
Yeah.
I'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside that would make us cry if we talked about it.
Do you have something balled up inside you? Oh, I got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional.
Hey, text message.
Let's give this bad boy a read.
It's probably just for you.
I've never gotten one of these.
Uh, it's probably You just It's just for your eyes.
""Say you have to pee.
I need to talk to you.
"" ""Say you have to pee.
"" That is weird.
""Say you have to pee.
"" Yeah.
Do you have to pee? No.
That's so weird.
Well, I'm stumped.
That's very creepy.
That makes two of us.
What's that? Does it say you have to pee? No, it's just someone with a misguided grasp of abbreviation.
I just need five minutes, you guys.
So go ahead and study all the verbs in Spanish.
Abed, what's your read on that guy? Yeah.
You look like Elizabeth Shue.
Just act natural, pretend you're watching the athletic proceedings.
You couldn't stop me from watching them.
There's a guy trying out for track that is older than the game of poker.
He's kind of trucking.
Suppose I was to say to you it was possible to get those test answers.
I would say go for that.
And could have said so in a text.
I'm asking if you know the difference between right and wrong.
I discovered at a very early age that if I talked long enough, I could make anything right or wrong.
So either I'm God or truth is relative, and in either case, booyah.
Oh.
Interesting.
It's just, the average person has a much harder time saying booyah to moral relativism.
Duncan, you don't have to play shrink to protect your pride.
I accept you're chicken.
You trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist? No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless British twit.
I'm a professor.
You can't talk to me that way.
A 6-year-old girl could.
Yes, because that would be adorable.
No, because you're a 5-year-old girl, and there's a pecking order.
Fine, I'll do it.
Thank you.
Yeah, with pleasure.
Bye.
Yes, good.
Why am I still shouting? I'm drawing attention to myself.
You guys aren't going to believe this but the rest of the group is here.
Are you the board-certified tutor? That means you do my homework, right, Seacrest? I need to call my babysitter if we gonna be late.
What board certifies a tutor? Where's Britta? Not sure.
I invited people from Spanish class.
Is that cool? It's the coolest.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
And bring my jacket, wallet and keys with me in case there's a fire.
Should we go with him? Gonna leave my homework with Slumdog Millionaire.
That's borderline racist.
And busted.
Listen Now you know.
I'm a smoker.
Yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.
You ready to get started? Looks like your group showed up.
Not mine.
I think Abed took out a page on Craigslist.
And I was trained never to say this, but I think that group may be untutorable.
Oh, really? Why don't you and I go study over Dinner? Or drinks.
I think, actually, we should prioritize here and study first and then go to dinner.
And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.
Oh, they will be untutorable.
All right.
Look at this crew.
All ready to study all night.
I can stay at least till 10.
But who studies with strangers, right? My name is Jeff.
Jeff, it's a pleasure.
My name is Pierce Hawthorne.
And, yes, that is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne Wipes the award-winning moist towelette.
I was just gonna ask.
I'm a Toastmaster.
I should do the introductions.
Definitely.
You know Brittles.
Britta.
Abed.
Abed the Arab.
Is that inappropriate? Sure.
Roy, Roy, the wonder boy Troy.
Little princess Elizabeth Annie.
And, finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley.
Is that even close? I'd like to know why I had to find out about this group on accident.
Way more like Breakfast Club now.
There's breakfast? We should get started I've been a part of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension.
Shouldn't we address Annie's concern? Did we not invite her? Sweetie, it's not behind your back Can we stop with the ""pumpkins"" and the ""sweeties""? Being younger does not make me inferior.
If anything, your age indicates that you've made bad life decisions.
Shirley has a response to that.
No, no, no.
I don't.
It looks like you do.
Shirley, go ahead.
Okay, okay.
I'm sure I've made some bad life decisions.
And maybe Annie's decisions will be better.
I think she needs to decide whether she wants to be considered a child or an adult, because children get pity, but not respect, and adults, they get respect.
They also get their head grabbed and pushed through jukeboxes.
Okay.
Why don't we try learning ""jukebox"" in Spanish? What are you doing? Pierce.
Let's discuss this creepiness.
Pardon you? What are you doing? I'm certified.
Are you unaware that Shirley finds your advances inappropriate? What advances? You have been sexually harassing me since the very first day of class.
Sexually harassing? What? That makes no sense to me.
Why would I harass somebody who turns me on? Saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.
Hey.
I am a prominent business leader and a highly sought-after dinner guest.
And I will not take courting advice from some teenage boy.
Well, this teenage boy is a quarterback and a prom king.
You're not prom king anymore, Troy.
This isn't Riverside High.
How'd you know I went there? Because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket, and, more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra.
Were you that girl got hooked on pills and dropped out? You're little Annie Adderall.
And you're a stupid jock who lost scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.
Keg flip.
They're very hard to pull off.
Don't talk to me.
You don't know I'm a legend.
You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Bender family.
I got a carton of cigarettes.
The old man grabbed me.
He said, ""Hey, smoke up, Johnny.
"" No, Dad, what about you? Well, that actually was from The Breakfast Club.
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.
Dirty Dancing.
Hello? It's Professor Duncan.
Come to the parking lot now.
What's wrong with your voice? I'm disguising it.
I'll be right back.
But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out.
No stone unturned.
Go.
Get in the car.
Act as if we've either just finished or are yet to begin driving.
Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester.
I knew you could do it, buddy.
Thank you.
Whoa, there, grabby grabby.
What do I get? The satisfaction of being even.
Even, fairness, right, wrong.
There is no God.
Booyah, booyah.
What do you want from me? Your Lexus.
My car for a semester's worth of answers? Will it be just a semester, though, Jeff? Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years? I want payment in advance.
I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers.
You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies.
Have a nice disbarment hearing.
What am I supposed to drive? Take this car.
It's good for the earth.
So is wiping your butt with a leaf but it's not how a man gets around.
Golf cart.
It is a disaster in there.
Yeah.
Untutorable.
Do you like Thai food? I love Thai food.
Wait.
So this is a game to you? You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants? Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.
I did a little bit of lying to get close to you.
But how was I supposed to know that you were smart and cool.
You look like Elizabeth Shue.
You're unbelievable.
What do you want me to do? Maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.
Okay, if I do that, then dinner, right? Yeah, fine, whatever.
As if there's a dinner on earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douche bag.
Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.
All right, everybody.
I wanna say something.
Sit down.
Well, you don't have to yell.
I don't appreciate your tone.
What makes humans different from other animals? Feet.
No, no.
Come on, bears have feet.
We're the only species on earth that observes ""Shark Week.
"" Sharks don't even observe ""Shark Week,"" but we do.
For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve and go like this.
Oh.
And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside.
Because people can connect with anything.
We can sympathize with a pencil, we can forgive a shark, and we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for screenwriting.
Big mistake.
People can find the good in just about anything but themselves.
Look at me.
It's clear to all of you that I am awesome.
But I could never admit that.
That would make me an ass.
But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome.
She's driven.
We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts.
And Pierce, we need guys like Pierce.
This guy has wisdom to offer.
The Dalai Lama and l We should listen to him some time.
We wouldn't regret it.
And Shirley, Shirley has earned our respect.
Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman.
Don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was too specific to be improvised.
And Troy.
Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is.
You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No, they're trying to impress their high school's prom king.
And Abed.
Abed's a shaman.
You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup.
Because you know what, soup is better.
Abed is better.
You are all better than you think you are.
You are designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.
Soup? I want you to look to the person to your left.
Sorry.
Look at the person sitting next to you.
Look at her.
Okay.
This? Yeah.
I want you to extend to that person the same compassion you extend to sharks, pencils and Ben Affleck.
I want you to say to that person, ""I forgive you.
"" I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
You little twerp.
Pierce, I'd like you to say, ""I forgive you.
"" He didn't say it? I forgive you.
You've just stopped being a study group.
You have become something unstoppable.
I hereby pronounce you a community.
Oh, that's nice.
I like that.
This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore.
It's Stripes or Meatballs.
Anything with Bill Murray.
I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta.
Britta? I lied.
Thanks for calming everyone down.
But since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me.
I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.
Everybody ready? Fine.
And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test.
And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I wasted more than they wasted mine.
Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this group? I don't have a study group.
I made it up.
What about the speech? Made it up.
That's what I do.
I make things up.
And I got paid a lot of money to do it.
Before I came to this school-shaped toilet, I was a lawyer.
Oh, man, this ruins everything.
I thought you were like Bill Murray in his films.
But you're more like Michael Douglas in his films.
Yeah? Well, you have Asperger's.
What does that mean? Ha, ha.
Ass burger.
It's a serious disorder.
It really is.
If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis? Heh, heh.
Yeah.
Heh, heh.
Ass burger.
Burger for your ass.
Jeffrey, before you say anything, you might want to think about the gift you've been given.
An excuse to punch a hippy? No.
No, not that.
An important lesson, my friend.
You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale.
What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.
Why are people trying to teach me things at a school that has an express tuition aisle? Give me my keys.
No, I have to keep your car for the lesson.
Don't hit me.
Please don't hit me.
Jeffrey? Jeffrey? Are we cool? Are we cool? We cool.
I like you, Jeffrey.
You remind me of myself at your age.
I deserve that.
You know I've been divorced seven times? Sometimes I think I'm doing something wrong.
You keep getting married.
I never looked at it that way.
Shouldn't you guys be studying? Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left.
Let me ask you something.
People have been clowning me about this jacket since I got here.
But, if I take it off to make them happy, that just makes me weak, right? Listen, it doesn't matter.
You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off.
Either way, it's for them.
That's what's weak.
Whoa.
You just wrinkled my brain, man.
He's good, isn't he? He's real good.
Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers? I don't have any of the answers.
I'm gonna flunk the test.
If you just, like, study for an hour, it's not that hard.
You seem pretty smart.
You got a sports coat.
Well, the funny thing about being smart is you can get through most of life without having to do work.
So I'm not really sure how to do that.
Please? So sad? He makes me wanna What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? Can you hear me talking right now? Yes.
That's good.
You know what, Jeff, actually, we didn't get that far without you.
So if you wanna come back upstairs Really? Well, it is your study group, so Come on, let's study.
Sounds good.
Come on.
Pressure.
I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas.
And I see your value now.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.",success
38,Black-ish,"Okay, so, I'm just your standard, regular ol' incredibly handsome, unbelievably charismatic black dude.
Now, this drooling, pigment-challenged, mixed-race woman is my wife, Rainbow.
And, despite what she looks like right now, she's a doctor.
We're lucky.
We've got a great house, four great kids, and my Pops.
It's a far cry from where it all began.
That's why I promised my parents I'd get an education, graduate, and get myself out of there.
I guess for a kid from the hood, I'm living the American Dream.
The only problem is, whatever American had this dream probably wasn't where I'm from.
And if he was, he should've mentioned the part about how when brothers start getting a little money, stuff starts getting a little weird like in my neighborhood.
Sometimes I feel like a bit of an oddity.
And if you look to your left, you'll see the mythical and majestic Black Family out of their natural habitat and yet still thriving.
Go ahead and wave.
They'll wave right back.
- They're smiling.
Hi.
Hello.
- The little ones are cute.
They're just just amazing.
Sometimes I worry that, in an effort to make it, black folks have dropped a little bit of their culture and the rest of the world has picked it up.
They even renamed it ""Urban"".
And in the ""Urban"" world, Justin Timberlake and Robin Thicke are R&B Gods, Kim Kardashian's the symbol for big butts, and asian guys are just unholdable on the dance floor.
Come on! Big butts? R&B and dancing? Those were the black man's go-tos! I'm definitely not complaining.
I love my life.
And not that I want to go back to the days of being the big scary black guy.
But I have to admit it did kind of have its advantages.
SO1EO1 ""Pilot"" Even though we were close, my Pops had a weird way of showing he loved me.
Hey, Pops.
Hey, hey, son, can I just get some coffee in me before you start with all that mess? And by ""weird,"" I meant he didn't show it at all.
- Good morning, Zoey.
- Hey, dad.
Are you wearing that awful cologne again? - Why? - Because it smells like you're wearing the awful cologne again.
Did seem like a pretty straightforward question there, son.
Right? Nice try.
I'm not gonna let you ruin my day.
Good morning, Mr.
Senior Vice President.
- Mwah! Hey.
- Hey, baby.
Hear that, Pops? Stevens is announcing my SVP promotion at work today.
Yeah, and if you'd have joined that black firm, like I told you, you'd have been Mr.
President five years ago.
Yeah, but for half the money.
So? It's a black company.
You got to make an adjustment for the negro inflation tax.
Pops, I am gonna be the first black SVP at Stevens & Lido.
This job is about more than just money to me.
It's about breaking down barriers.
Yeah.
Breaking down barriers equally important to money.
But just so that I'm clear, there is a salary increase, right? - Okay.
- Yes, baby.
All right.
Hey, Junior.
Mm, mm, mm, mm! Unh! - All right, all right.
Let's go.
- All right.
Oh, why don't y'all go get a room? I can't believe I marched on Washington and fought for my country to watch y'all do that mess.
You shot yourself in the foot to get out of the army.
And you were in D.
C.
for an Isley Brothers concert.
- You shot yourself? - Can we see? - Look here.
- Pops.
I want to see! Why do you have to get to school so early, son? Oh, uh, tryouts are today.
I want to get a little extra work in so I'd be ready.
Okay.
Work on the handle.
Lock down that point-guard spot.
Um there's no point guards in field hockey, dad.
Field hockey?! Man, isn't that a woman's sport? Nope.
Um, a lot of people think that, though.
A lot of people never think about field hockey, man.
What happened? We were hoopin' all summer long.
I thought you were gonna try out for the team, show these valley glen boys The Johnson Family jumper.
The Johnson Family wha dad, you didn't hit one jump shot all summer.
Hey.
It's not about the accuracy, son, all right? The family is known for our form.
Look at that.
Look at that elbow.
Look at that.
Right.
Anyway, I thought about playing hoop, but all my friends are fee-hocking it this year, so I figured, you know, when in Rome W when in Rome? You are not in Rome! You're in L.
A.
! You know what? I'm not gonna let you ruin my day.
Field hockey.
- What's up, Mr.
J? - What's up, Zach? - What's up, Andy? - What's up? ""Andy""? That's not even close to ""Andre"".
I think it says I'm edgy but approachable.
I think it says, ""I hate my father and I play field hockey"".
Well, Zach thinks it's cool, and it's also a derivative of ""Andre"".
We discussed it, and I think I like that There were so few of us at Stevens & Lido that being black made you feel like you were part of a little family.
So when one of us made it, it was kind of like we all did.
Who do you think you are? And right now, I was that one.
I'm not saying I was the Jackie Robinson of Stevens & Lido advertising or anything, but, I mean, if other people were saying it, they wouldn't be wrong.
Hold on a second.
- Killer Kris.
- Big Dre, what up? Or should I say ""Mr.
Senior Vee-peezy""? This is my assistant, Kris.
Notice how I do the shake with him.
That's because I consider him an honorary brother.
- Hey, Kris, let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.
Did you ever want to play the same sport your dad played in high school? Are you kidding? Of course.
My dad was a frickin' field-hockey God.
Meeting's in 10.
Whatever.
Yo! Dr.
Dre! This is Josh.
Um not an honorary brother.
Just ""Andre"".
All right, sorry, ""Andre"", hey bro Uh-oh, I mean Andre, listen, we're working on this folgers copy, and we wanted to know how you think a black guy would say ""good morning"".
Hmm.
Probably just like that.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Hey, hey, Stevens called a meeting, and I think something big might be up.
- Really? - Yeah.
You know, I'm hearing ""historic,"" ""game-changing"" being tossed around.
Could just be office gossip.
Ha ha! If I could have your attention At Stevens & Lido, there was a clear separation between lower management and upper management.
And that always made me feel like it was us - versus them.
- get ready to work.
Even our snacks were divided.
We get cheetos and grape soda, while they always get what looks like a medieval feast! Let's eat, let's eat! Ha ha.
That's why this promotion was such a big deal.
For once, one of us was going to get a chance to be one of them.
More wine! More wine! To us! Like my daddy said, you chase a squirrel, you better be prepared to eat his nuts.
All right, uh I'm sure you've all heard I have an announcement.
Uh, myself and the board have decided to up a new Senior Vice President here in the company.
What?! ha ha! That's crazy! Oh, my God! Hey, hey, but very wise.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And this new SVP will also be heading up our creative presentation to grab the $250 million L.
A.
tourism account.
All right.
It is a big deal for us.
We need a home run here.
Sabrina, I'm not gonna forget about you when I become one of them, all right? Excuse me.
Excuse me.
All right.
- Uh, excuse me.
Yeah.
- change who we are.
So, without any further ado, I would like us all to give a warm congrats to the SVP of our new Urban division, Andre Johnson! Huh?! That's right.
- Andre! - Uh, I'm I'm sorry.
Uh did you say ""Urban""? Urban division.
Wait.
Did they just put me in charge of black stuff? I don't like the social media at the table - Junior, pass the hot sauce.
- I told you that.
Okay.
Hello! Okay.
To my husband, Senior Vice President.
- Yes! - Yeah! - Congrats to my son! - Yeah! Finally made it, son.
- Finally made it - Holla! To head puppet of the white man.
Oh, Pops.
Come on.
You're here to celebrate him.
Actually, you told me I was coming over to eat fried chicken.
- I have no idea what the hell this is.
- It's fried chicken.
- Really? - It's baked fried chicken.
Oh, so fried fried chicken is too black for you.
- Pops! Pops, seriously? - Hey, hey.
Babe, babe.
- What? - You know what? Pops is right.
You know, I I do feel like a puppet.
As you should.
I said I wanted to be the first black SVP for Stevens & Lido, when, actually, I wanted to be the first SVP who happened to be black.
What's the difference? Obama's the first black president.
I mean, does that make him any less president? No.
No, because he's the first black president of the United States, not the first black president of the Urban United States.
Obama's the first black president? What you're doing a bang-up job over here.
No, no, no.
Hold on a second.
Let's explore this.
Jack, did you really not know that Obama was the first black president? He's the only president I've ever known.
- ""Only"".
Did you hear that? ""Only"".
- He gets a pass.
So that explains his complete lack of Presidential Trivia.
Hey.
You two.
You knew that Obama was the first black president, right? - I g guess.
- Okay.
""Okay""? Mm-hmm.
See what I'm talking about? Baked chicken.
- What you doing? - Looking at pictures of my Urban family.
Oh, my God.
You got to stop with the whole pity-party thing.
You don't think I go through this kind of thing all the time being a female doctor? It's not that big of a deal.
You got to keep it real.
- ""Keep it real"".
O okay.
- That's what I said.
All all this coming from, uh, a biracial or mixed or omni-colored-complexion, whatever-it-is-they're- calling-it-today woman - who technically isn't even really black? - Okay, well, if I'm not really black, then could somebody please tell my hair and my ass? - Babe, you don't get it.
- No.
- This is how it starts.
- What? Babe, Junior wants to play field hockey.
- I know.
What's wrong with that? - I today, it's field hockey.
Tomorrow, he's running from the police in a white bronco.
Oh, my God are you suggesting that our son is gonna grow up and murder his wife? - Aha! You think O.
J.
did it! - Oh, come on.
We can't have a keeping-it-real conversation with that attitude.
No, no, no.
Stop, babe.
- Baby, the gloves didn't fit! - No, focus, Dre.
- You need to focus.
- Okay.
This is what you always wanted.
This is your dream and this is our plan.
We're gonna climb the Himalayas, sex in the Louvre, and then we're gonna successfully raise our family in a better situation than we had.
If you pass up this promotion, we're 0 for 3.
Maybe you're right, babe.
- Ooh.
Thank you.
I love you, too.
- Ooh.
You're welcome.
Mwah.
I love you.
- No.
- You didn't even let me get it out.
I know, 'cause I can hear what you're thinking.
- Okay, well, I'm just gonna do it.
- No.
no! There he is my main man.
Can't wait to see what you do with that presentation.
Me too.
Really looking forward to it.
And, remember, really put your swag on it, you know? Keep it keep it real.
Keep it real? Yeah.
Be honest, be smart, be you.
What, uh, what did you think I meant? I thought you meant that.
Okay.
""Keep it real"".
What's up, Drigitty-Dre? - * Rewind * - My name's not - Drigitty-Dre-Dre what? Kick it.
- That's inappropriate! Highly inappropriate! - Hey, babe.
- Mommy, mommy.
- Mom.
- Yeah? Liza Jackson asked if we could have a playdate.
She's weird, so feel free to say ""no"".
Liza Jackson? Which one is she? You know, wears the Nemo shoes every single day? And the polka-dot backpack.
Kind of smells like a Turkey Burger.
Wait a second.
Are you guys talking about the only other little black girl in your class? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you just say that? - I don't know.
Guess when I hear ""Liza Jackson,"" I just think ""Nemo and Turkey Burgers"".
- Yep.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
What? Don't you think that's beautiful? They don't see color.
No.
I think they need to be tested.
But when I say it, I'm wrong.
I made the team! Whoo! Yes! Oh, my goodness! - That's so exciting! - Of course you did.
- Yes! Oh, God, I'm so happy! - Thank you.
Uh, Zach? Can I help you with something? Uh, yeah, I've just been craving some grape soda all day, and my parents just never buy any.
- And why would you assume we have - Found it! Oh, and, dad, me and some of the field mob decided what I should do - for my birthday party.
- Field mob? - I want to have a Bar Mitzvah.
- A And before you say anything, I know we're not Jewish, but Zach knows a rabbi who's great at pushing through conversions, so Hold on so you'd be willing to forsake your own religion to have a party? Short answer yes.
- Are you listening to this? - Dad, now that I think about it, if I do, you won't have to worry about anyone calling me ""Andy"" anymore, because when I convert, I'll get a Hebrew name.
I'm gonna go with either ""Scholomo"" or ""Shmuel"".
- What? - Both pretty solid, bro.
Shut up! Shut you know what? Family meeting! Everybody, 'round the table now! I smell a group hug coming on.
I'm going to the track.
See you later, Pops.
All right, listen up.
I may have to be ""Urban"" at work, but I'm still going to need my family to be black.
Not Black-ish - Wha - but black.
So we're gonna start with some strict guidelines.
So, then he sent me a smiley face with a wink.
- I mean, I should be offended, right? - Zoey! - I'll text you.
- Alright.
From heretoforth, we are going to keep it real.
So, Junior, if I hear anybody calling you ""Scholomo"" or ""Shmuel"" or especially ""Andy,"" I'm gonna back you over and whoever else is saying it in my car.
- Dad - Quiet! Now, I may have to watch you play possibly the dumbest sport in the world, but I do not have to sit back and listen to you rave about other kids' Bar Mitzvahs.
So, next Saturday, when you turn 13, you're becoming a man, too a black man, because I'm throwing you an African rites of passage ceremony.
That does not sound as fun.
No, it does not.
Okay, I have an idea.
Why don't we take a black break and go get some white yogurt? - Yeah! - Yeah! Hey, hey! Hold on, hold on.
Slow your roll, you two.
From here on out, I'm gonna need you two to describe people using keeping-it-real identifications.
""The assailant was a hispanic male between the ages of 10 and 60"".
See? Now I know who I'm looking for.
Mommy, daddy's scaring me.
Me too, baby.
Me too.
Really? Okay, are we done with this whole life-and-death, keeping-it-real speech? Because I need to start prepping for a and I'm not gonna be thinking about keeping it real.
I'm gonna be thinking about keeping him alive.
You're not the only one in this house with an important job.
My job is pretty important.
And, as I recall, you were the one who brought up this keeping-it-real argument.
- So this is my fault? - Yes, it's your fault.
- Oh, this is my fault? - Oh, yes.
And, tomorrow, I have a very important presentation to make.
And you know what I'm gonna do when I go in there? I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna keep it real as Yeah, because that's what you told me to do.
Oh, I'm pretty sure that's not what I told you to do.
Oh, no, that's exactly what you said.
If she thinks I'm finished with keeping it real, I am just getting started.
And if Stevens & Lido really wants an Urban SVP, i'll give them their Urban SVP.
- Ha! - Oh, my God.
Lalonde Leonard landing at will.
And Lalonde goes down! _ So, that's my Urban pitch for the L.
A.
tourism account.
Thoughts? We're not really doing this, right? I thought it was funny.
Operation ""Keepin' It Real"" was in full effect, and although it was off to a rocky start, I still had high hopes.
Andre.
- Yes? - What is this mess you're doing? This ain't no mess, Pops.
This is our culture.
This ain't our culture.
We black, not African.
Africans don't even like us.
Dad, can I go? No.
Stand right there and experience your roots.
You're better off watching ""Roots"".
Should I start, or do you want to? Okay.
Okay.
Uh, take that, son.
Take that! - What is he doing? - Don't look at me.
Hey, Bow.
Look, baby, I had the boy wanted a Bar Mitzvah! Bow, I could use your support right now.
I was trying to support you when I called you at work today, and my call was rerouted to Corporate Security.
And they questioned me for like 30 minutes about my husband's mental state.
Hmm.
Weird.
Next time, just call my cell.
Ohh.
Dre, what happened at work today? Look, Mr.
Stevens failed to fully grasp the irony of my pitch, so we mutually decided that we would take the weekend to figure out if Stevens & Lido was still a perfect fit for me.
Still a perfect fit? Dre? He's thinking about firing you? I guess, if you want to oversimplify it like that.
Oh, my God.
Dre! There is no winning with you! You're upset because they gave you the job because you're black.
If they'd given it to someone white, you'd be upset they didn't give it to someone black! This ""keeping it real"" B.
S.
has got to stop.
I'm not gonna have you running around torturing my son.
What was that? What are you wear what are you wearing? Whatever issues you are working through, you need to get over them now.
Okay? Nice shot.
So much for The Johnson Family form.
Dad, listen, I get it.
You feel like I'm turning into a white boy.
But I'm not.
I'm just being me.
I'm just not quite sure who that is yet.
Son, I realize how difficult it must be to feel like the different one at school.
But it's also important for you to hold on to your culture and realize how special it is.
Honestly, the only thing I'm really trying to hold on to right now is my first boob.
I'm a ninth-grader playing varsity.
That means something.
So this was all a part of your plan.
Yeah.
Me and the field mob Hey, son, please stop calling yourselves that.
Fine.
Me and my boys figured that if we could just get our foot in the door with other jocks, we'd really get in there and make some noise.
So, you really do want to play basketball.
Yeah, dad.
But I suck at it.
All right, little man, get in the house.
Go.
Who knew? Boy wants to hold a boob.
You can't be mad at him for that.
Hey, Pops, how the hell did you keep it real with us - when we were growing up? - I didn't.
I kept it honest.
So, I really screwed this up, didn't I? Screwing things up is just another part of what it means to be a father, Dre.
It's how you learn to fix things.
Just remember, son, whatever you do, make sure it's right for who you are.
If that boy wants a Bar Mitzvah, I'm gonna throw that boy a Bar Mitzvah.
There you go.
""Hold a boob"".
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Andre Jr.
's Hip-Hop Bro Mitzvah.
.
Sometimes keeping it real means admitting you were wrong but, as a dad, still finding a way to be right.
Be damned if I'm calling him Andy, though.
So, that Los Angeles tourism campaign went a lot better once I realized that ""Urban"" can also mean Hip, Cool, and Colorful, just like my family.
So, taking a cue from my very wise son, I decided to get my foot in the door and really make some noise.
And just like that, I became the SVP of Stevens & Lido's Urban Division.
The funny thing is I didn't feel Urban.
I just feel like a dad.
who was willing to do whatever he had to for his family.
And isn't that the American Dream?",success
39,The Office,"All right, Jim.
Your quarterlies look very good.
- How are things at the library? - I told you.
I couldn't close it.
So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? Actually, you called me in here, but, yeah.
All right.
Well, let me show you how it's done.
I'd like to speak to your office manager, please.
Yes, hello.
This is Michael Scott.
I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products.
Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manager.
All right.
Done deal.
Thank you very much, sir.
You're a gentleman and a scholar.
Oh, I'm sorry.
OK.
I'm sorry.
My mistake.
That was a woman I was talking to, so She had a very low voice.
Probably a smoker, so So that's the way it's done.
I've, er, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager.
If you want to come through here We have the entire floor.
So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see.
This is our receptionist, Pam.
Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beasley.
Pam has been with us for forever.
Right, Pam? Well, I don't know.
If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a few years ago.
- What? - Any messages? Er, yeah.
Just a fax.
Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate.
How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet.
- You haven't told me.
- It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that.
Look at that face.
People say I am the best boss.
They go, ""We've never worked in a place like this.
You're hilarious.
""And you get the best out of us.
"" I think that pretty much sums it up.
I found it at Spencer Gifts.
Shall I play for you? Pa rum pum pum pum I have no gifts for you Pa rum pum pum pum My job is to speak to clients on the phone about er, quantities and type of copier paper.
You know, whether we can supply it to them.
Whether they can pay for it.
And I'm boring myself just talking about this.
- Whassup! - Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
- Whassup! - Whassup! Whass up! Whassup.
What? - Nothing.
- OK.
All right.
- See you later.
- All right.
- Take care.
- Back to work.
Just before lunch.
That would be great.
Corporate doesn't interfere with me.
Jan Levitson Gould.
Jan, hello.
I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Right? Not to her face, because Well, not because I'm scared of her.
Cos I'm not.
But, um Yeah.
Was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda? Umm Me no get an agenda.
- What? I'm sorry? - I didn't get any agenda.
I faxed one to you this morning.
Really? I didn't Did we get a fax this morning? Uh, yeah, the one Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it? You put it in the garbage can that was the special filing cabinet.
Yeah, that was a joke.
That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and It was for bills.
It doesn't work with faxes.
- Do you want to look at mine? - Lovely.
Thank you.
OK.
Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
- OK.
- Don't panic.
- No, this is good.
This is fine.
- Listen.
Don't panic.
- Alarm bells are ring-ding-ding! - We haven't decided.
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford and told him the same.
It's up to you to convince me your branch can incorporate the other.
But it does mean there'll be downsizing.
Me no wanna hear that, Jan.
Because downsizing is a bitch.
It is a real bitch.
And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men.
I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men.
Or women, present company excluded.
Sorry.
Er, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but downsizing? Question.
How long do we have to Todd Packer, terrific rep.
Do you mind if I take it? Go ahead.
- Packman.
- Hey, you big queen.
- That's not appropriate.
- Is old Godzillary coming in today? - I don't know what you mean.
- I've been meaning to ask her.
- Does the carpet match the drapes? - Oh, my God! Oh! That's horrifying.
Horrible.
Horrible person.
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? - I don't want to worry people.
- Absolutely.
Under this regime, it will not leave this office.
Like that.
- So what does downsizing actually mean? - Well you guys better update your résumés like I'm doing.
I bet it's gonna be me.
Probably gonna be me.
Yeah, it'll be you.
I have an important question for you.
Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday? Stop.
That is ridiculous.
Am I going to tell them? No.
I don't see the point.
As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- This is Mr.
Scott.
- Guilty as charged! Ryan Howard from the temp agency.
Daniqua sent me to start today.
Howard, like Moe Howard.
Three Stooges.
Watch this.
This is Moe.
Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck.
Mee! Right here.
Three Stooges.
High five.
Oh, Pam.
It's a guy thing, Pam.
I'm sort of a student of comedy.
Watch this.
Here we go.
I'm Hitler.
Adolf Hitler.
I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist.
I like to do illustrations.
Erm Mostly watercolor.
A few oil pencil.
Erm, Jim thinks they're good.
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.
Sure.
Mr.
Davis, let me call you right back.
Something just came up.
Two minutes.
Thank you.
- Dwight, what are you doing? - What? - Clearing my desk.
- It's not on your desk.
It's overlapping.
It's spilling over the edge.
One word, two syllables.
Demarcation.
- You can't do that.
- Why not? Safety violation.
I could fall and pierce an organ.
We'll see.
This is why the whole downsizing thing doesn't bother me.
Downsizing? I have no problem with that.
I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here.
I even brought it up in my interview.
I say, bring it on.
You have messages from yesterday.
Relax.
Everything's under control.
Er, Yeah.
Yeah.
That's important.
Right.
This is so important, I should run to answer it.
- What? - Come on.
Six Million Dollar Man.
Steve Austin.
Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan.
I deserve a raise.
- Don't we all? - I'm sorry? Nothing.
If you're unhappy with your compensation, take it up with HR.
Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.
I think I'm a role model.
I think I garner people's respect.
Attention all employees.
We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
The people I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope Abraham Lincoln, definitely.
Bono.
And probably God would be the fourth one.
And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words.
It's really incalculable.
I want to set the record straight.
I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
I should know first.
- Assistant to the Regional Manager.
- Can you tell me? Tell me quietly.
Whisper in my ear.
- I'm about to.
- Can you tell us? - Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em? - You don't know what it is.
You tell 'em.
With my permission.
Go ahead.
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me.
And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
I heard they might be closing this branch down.
That's just the rumor going around.
This is my first day.
I don't really know.
- What if they downsize here? - Not gonna happen.
- It'll be out of your hands.
- It won't be, Stanley.
I promise you that.
- Can you promise that? - On his mother's grave.
- What? - Well, yes, it is a promise.
Frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
We need to know.
I know.
Hold on.
I think Pam wanted to say something.
Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
I was in the meeting with Jan.
She did say this branch could get the axe.
Are you sure about that? Well, maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
Pam, information is power.
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you? No, Stanley.
You did not see me in there with her.
I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, they're gonna have to go through me.
You can mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillun.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Er, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me.
Watch out for this guy.
Dwight Shrute in the building.
- This is Ryan, the new temp.
- Introduce yourself.
Be polite.
Dwight Shrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
So, tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
Er I've got a '78280Z.
Bought it for - His profit.
- New engine, suspension, respray.
I've got some photos.
Damn it! Jim! OK.
Hold on.
The judge is in session.
What is the problem? He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
Real professional.
The third time.
It wasn't funny the first two.
It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed.
I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends.
And you cannot screw around there.
That's sort of one of the rules.
- What is that? - That is my stapler.
No.
Do not take it out.
Eat it out, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
You can be a witness.
Can you reprimand him? - How do you know it was me? - It's always you.
- Are you going to discipline him? - Discipline.
Kinky! Here's the deal, you guys.
The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start as well as when to stop.
And, yeah, Jim.
Now is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
OK.
Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
Nice.
That's the way it is around here.
- It goes round and round.
- You should put him in custardy.
Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
That's great.
I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property.
That's all.
Pudding.
Pudding I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink? - Yeah.
- That's why we're all going out.
For an end-of-the-week drink.
- When are we going out? - Tonight, hopefully.
- Hey, man.
- What's going on? Hi, baby.
Roy's my fiancé.
We've been engaged about three years.
We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys? No.
Come on.
Let's get out of here and go home.
OK.
I'm gonna be a few minutes.
It's only twenty past five.
I still have to do my faxes.
You know what? You should come with us.
It could be a good chance to see what people are like outside the office.
- I think it could be fun.
- It sounds good.
Seriously, we gotta get going.
Yeah, yeah.
Um What's in the bag? - Tell her I'll talk to her later.
- Definitely.
All right, dude.
Will do.
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard.
Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard.
I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, a boss second and probably an entertainer third.
Just a second.
Right? Oh, do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff? You are gonna be my accomplice.
Just go along with it, OK? Just follow my lead.
Don't pip me, all right? Come in.
- Corporate just said - You got a fax.
Thank you.
Can you come in here for a sec? I was gonna call you in anyway.
You know Ryan.
As you know, there is going to be downsizing.
And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
- What? Why? - Why? Well, theft and stealing.
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen? Post-it Notes.
Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents? If you steal a thousand Post-it Notes at 50 cents a piece, you know, you've made a profit margin.
You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
Are you serious? - Yeah.
I am.
- I can't believe this.
I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
The best thing about it is we're not going to have to give you any severance pay.
Because that is gross misconduct and Just clean out your desk.
I'm sorry.
You been X'd, punk! Surprise! It's a joke.
We were joking around.
See? OK.
He was in on it.
He was my accomplice.
It was kind of a morale booster thing.
We were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place.
So you God, we totally got you.
You're a jerk.
I don't know about that.
What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh.
It's the people.
The people.
My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee.
No, no, no, no, no.
It was a young Guatemalan guy.
First job in the country, barely spoke English.
He came to me, and said, ""Mr.
Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?"" Wow.
Wow.
Didn't work out.
We had to let him go.
He sucked.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How are you? I thought you were going for a drink with No.
I just decided not to.
- How's your headache? - It's better, thanks.
- Good.
That's great.
- Is? - Yeah? - Um Are you - Am I walking out? - Yes.
- Yes, I Do you want to - Yeah.
Great.
Let me just Oh, boy.
- Listen, have a nice weekend.
- Definitely.
You too.
Enjoy it.
You know what, just come here.",success
40,Fresh Off the Boat,"S01E01 Pilot Mom, check it.
Fresh as hell, right? Eddie, don't say ""hell.
"" He also said ""butthole"" in the car.
Shut up, Evan, you little Chinese narc! - Isn't that necklace heavy? - Life's heavy, son.
Please, mom, can I get this? How much? Too much.
Moms thought everything was too much.
She never understood that you couldn't haggle at jcpenney.
It's like, ""those are set prices, mom.
"" That's me, your boy Eddie Huang in the headphones.
My family was moving from Washington, D.
C.
, to Orlando, Florida.
I was 11 years old, and it was 1995.
This is the story of my family, an American family, the Huangs.
That's my dad.
He loved everything about America.
Full-on bought into the American dream.
Moms was always hard on me way before all that ""tiger mom"" stuff.
She thought I was trying to cause trouble wearing that nas shirt, but she didn't understand.
If you were an outsider, hip-hop was your anthem.
And I was definitely the black sheep in my family.
These other people are Emery, Evan, and grandma.
Whatever.
Was I excited about the move? No.
Did anyone ask me if I was excited? Hell, no.
But it's hard getting respect when you're 11.
Ugh, dad! Turn off the music! Eddie, I know you're not excited to leave D.
C.
, but you're gonna love Orlando.
I've been there for six months setting up the restaurant, and I've grown to love it like the daughter we wished Evan had been.
Hmm? I don't know why we have to move.
Why couldn't you keep on going back and forth between Orlando and D.
C.
? Because I didn't come to America to work for your mom's brother selling furniture for the rest of my life.
Your father is right.
This is why we left Chinatown in D.
C.
This is why we left our family and friends.
Exactly.
This is why we left everything we know to come to a place where we know nothing and where the humidity is not good for my hair.
- Right, okay.
- And for what? So your father can own a cowboy restaurant.
It's called Cattleman's Ranch Steakhouse, and I can't wait for you all to see it.
It is beautiful.
It is big, brown, and beautiful.
- Like Shaq? - Exactly like Shaq.
Why you like Shaq so much? Why you not like Pete Sampras? So sexy.
All that hair.
He's okay.
Oh, your favorite song.
Lot of white folks here.
Not like back in D.
C.
Yeah.
The only white people we ever saw there were the tourists who got lost.
White.
House.
Hey, you boys just gonna sit there or pick up a box and help? Mom, is there a Chinatown in Orlando? Hey, no more question, Barbara Walters.
Pick up a lamp.
Well, hi.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
I'm Deidre.
This is Amanda.
This is Samantha.
This is Lisa.
This is Carol-Joan.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- I'm Jessica.
- Oh.
I was expecting something a little more exotic, but I love the name Jessica.
Had a sorority sister with that name.
She died in a horrible riptide accident, but we dedicated a section of the highway to her.
Anyway, where you guys from? My parents were born in Taiwan, but my brothers and I were born in D.
C.
Oh! Your English is very good! Are you all sister? Anyhoo, well, we've got to motor, but we go rollerblading every day, so if you ever want to join us, just give us a holler.
Come on.
The loudest one seem to be their queen.
So, who's hungry? The cactuses were planted in old spittoons.
I wanted it to be authentic, you know, like the real wild west.
The waiters used to wear spurs, but they were right at achilles level, so we had to switch to the black reeboks.
Right, Nancy? I got sliced up pretty bad.
She did.
Dude, where the hell are we? I don't think Shaq eats here.
Were there bears in the old west? Ni ta i ma nle.
Where are all the customer? Technically, we are still in our soft opening, so Louis, there is hardly anyone here, and that table is only drinking water.
Hey, why you not drink beer?! The restaurant is doing well, okay? Just not as well as it could be.
Why didn't you tell me? Because I didn't want to give you another reason not to move here.
I just have to figure out why the people aren't coming.
Maybe it's the food.
It's not the food.
The food is perfect.
Hector's a genius.
Can I sit next to you on the bus? Sure.
If you want.
Me and Emery are gonna sit next to each other on our bus.
You're on a different bus because you're at a different school, so I don't know who you'll sit next to.
Definitely not Emery, though.
He'll be next to me.
Oh, shut up, Evan.
Mom, why do we have to start school on a Wednesday? Why can't we wait till Monday? Why wait? You need to go to school so you go to college so you can make lots of money.
All you care about is money.
Do me a favor.
Go find a homeless man.
Ask him if he thinks money matters.
You tell me what he says.
You're all about the eggs.
Eddie, eggs are life.
You came from my eggs.
Okay, so I want you all to be polite, respectful, and don't make waves.
Why you only looking at me? No, I'm talking to all of you.
Dude, you were looking right at me.
Okay, I was talking to you.
Why do all your shirts have black men on them? It's notorious B.
I.
G.
! Me and him are both dudes with mad dreams, just trying to get a little bit of respect in the game, just trying to get a nut.
Jessica, I figured it out.
Dad, how come we have to start school on a Wednesday? That's a great question.
Go to school.
Go, go, go, go.
I was blow-drying my hair, and I figured it out how the restaurant can attract bigger crowds.
Well, how? I need to hire a white host.
Instead of people coming in and seeing a Chinese face and saying, ""huh? I thought this was an old west steakhouse,"" they see a white face and say, ""oh, hello, white friend.
I am comfortable.
"" See? Exactly.
Not welcoming.
That's why no to your face and yes to the white face! Nice, happy white face, like Bill Pullman.
Class, I'd like to introduce you to a new student.
I know it's a little unorthodox being a Wednesday and all, but I'd like you all to give a warm, Abraham Lincoln middle school welcome to ""Hung-ge Yi Minge.
"" Yeah, call me Eddie.
Oh, thank God.
What's up? Cool if I sit? No.
Fine, but don't try to talk to me.
I don't like kids.
My best friend is a 40-year-old man.
Yo.
Yo, Chinese kid.
What's your name again? Something Chinese? My name's Eddie.
Eddie? You into B.
I.
G.
? Yeah, man.
He's sick.
I bought ""Ready to die"" the day it came out.
You bought it? I stole it.
- Yo, come sit with us.
- Yeah? Okay, man.
Cool.
A white dude and an Asian dude bonding over a black dude.
This cafeteria's ridiculous.
So, I'm Eddie.
- What's up? - Hey, dude.
What's up, man? Yeah, so my cousin told me about B.
I.
G.
when I went to visit him last summer, and he Oh! What is that?! Gross! It's Chinese food.
My mom made it.
Get it out of here! Oh, my God! Ying Ding's eating worms.
Go! Go! Oh! Get that out of here! Go! Dude, that smells nasty! Oh, it didn't go well? The white people didn't welcome you with open arms? What? Sit elsewhere, B.
I.
G.
Oh, I cannot believe Jake slept with Brittany.
He knew Palmer woodward was using her as part of a plot to destroy him and help Amanda take controlling interest of Melrose Place.
Right, Jessica? Yes.
All those white people sound like they are making mistake.
Oh, the school bus is here! I should go see how my boys' day was.
Okay, sugar.
Bye.
I'm making you a mixtape.
I hope you like Eric Clapton.
Thank you.
Hey.
So, how was your first They said my lunch smelled! It smelled delicious? No, they said it stank, mom! I had to eat behind the gym where the janitor flies his kite.
This is nice.
Well, those kids, they just don't know, that's all.
It just it just take time to get used to something different.
I hate it here! I want to go back to D.
C.
Eddie, that's not possible.
We are here now.
We have to make the best of it.
Like I am doing with this neighbor woman.
You think I like pretending Samantha isn't carrying a baggie of dog poops in her hand? No! I don't like this! We all see the poops there! It's rolling around! But I am trying! You have to try, too.
You're never on my side.
Eddie.
Eddie, wait! Hey, mom.
This is my girlfriend, Kim.
Hi, Mrs.
Huang.
- I'm gonna walk her home, okay? - Bye, Mrs.
Huang.
Mom.
There's a fat kid at school named J.
J.
, and he's hilarious.
Help mommy.
Thank you.
It's a great resume.
Yeah, I've always wanted to work at a Golden Corral.
This isn't a Golden Corral.
Yes, it is.
Isn't it? This is Cattleman's Ranch.
But I thought like a spin-off of Golden Corral 'cause it's got all the same stuff.
It's not the same stuff.
It's very different stuff.
Well, that bear is the same.
No, that bear is brown.
At Golden Corral, the bear is black.
- The snake skins? - Different snake.
Completely different snake.
Okay, yeah.
Look, you're the boss.
If you tell me this is not a Golden Corral, - I'm gonna believe you.
- No, it's completely different.
- You're crazy.
- I am.
I'm I mean, I'm not super crazy, 'cause it does look exactly the same.
This is the original Cattleman's Ranch Steakhouse.
- So there's more than one? - N-no, there's just one.
There's no other restaurant like it, okay? - Okay.
- Okay.
So, Mitch, tell me where are you from? Orlando, born and raised.
I love Orlando.
Where else am I gonna see an alligator run out on the street and eat a cat? I am a cat person, too.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
Mitch, you're hired.
Well, Evan is not going to school today.
His fat friend J.
J.
gave him string cheese, and apparently, he is lactose intolerant.
His body is rejecting white culture, which make me kind of proud.
Good job, Evan.
Mom, no! I don't want Chinese lunch! I want white-people food! The kids at school will get used to it! Ugh! You're never on my side.
What are you doing? You're not gonna have any lunch to eat.
I'll be fine.
Kids aren't teasing you about your lunch? - No, not yet.
- They will.
- People here suck.
- Totally.
- Hey, Emery! - Hey, what's up? Oh, hey, Emery.
You coming to my birthday party next weekend? Hey, George.
I'll be there.
Hey, boo.
Got you a soda.
Why aren't chicks bringing me soda? You want it too much.
Hey, Mitch.
Hey.
How's the lunch crowd? It's still the same? I just think we have to give it time, you know? - Get the word out there.
- No.
I moved my whole family here for this.
I need your caucasian features to work now! My wife is not a patient woman.
Do you know how many times she tried to start a garden? Have you ever seen a woman yelling at seeds? - ""Grow! Grow!"" - I hear you.
You know, my mom is the worst roommate.
It's like, if you're making toast, make us both toast.
Uh, that's why there's two slots, you know? I talked to my sister today.
My brother bought a brand-new miata.
It's not new.
There's no way that car is new.
- I think it's new.
- No.
- New.
- No.
It's not new.
Eddie, why are you eating so much? I'm hungry.
Didn't you eat your lunch today? Yeah, but I'm still hungry.
Oh, okay.
How you like the xiaolongbao I pack you? - It was really good.
- Liar.
I did not pack xiaolongbao! Okay.
Fine.
I threw my lunch away.
- I cannot believe you, Eddie! - Come on, Eddie.
- That's wasteful, man.
- This is good food I make.
You love my food.
I need white-people lunch.
That gets me a seat at the table.
And then you get to change the rules.
Represent, like nas says.
I'm not trying to eat with the janitor for the rest of my life.
I got big plans.
First, get a seat at the table.
Second, meet Shaq.
Third, change the game.
Possibly with the help of Shaq.
Damn it, that was beautiful.
That filthy music you listen to turned you into a poet, boy.
Okay.
What is this white-people lunch? What is this store so excited about? This is where lunchables live, mom.
If we get separated, try and join a white family.
You will be safe there until I can find you.
Whoa.
This is not how I like to shop.
This place looks like a hospital.
I miss the taiwanese markets back in D.
C.
They make me feel so calm.
Wow.
Everything fits perfectly inside the box.
Awesome! You want to fit inside a box? That's so American.
- Why are you so American? - Fiesta tortilla chip? Free sample.
This is free? Okay! How are you doing? Everyone getting ready for the shoot? You good, Nancy? Can I have Saturday off? I'm deejaying a bat mitzvah.
Nope.
Hey, Joe, no Margaritas till after the shoot, okay? Okay.
Hey, Mr.
Cattleman.
How we feeling? We all ready to go? Uh, not really.
I feel like I've told you numerous times.
I don't want to do this, but all you do is smile and nod.
No, you're doing it.
No, that you're doing it.
What is all this, Louis? We are shooting a local commercial.
A commercial? Why didn't you tell me? How much is this going to cost us?! Come here.
Come on.
I miss our family and friends in Washington, D.
C.
And Eddie's having a hard time at school.
And Evan is lactose intolerant.
And Emery well, Emery's doing surprisingly well.
But all you care about is the stupid restaurant, which is the whole reason I agreed to move here! Because you say it was doing well! It's not doing well! And so I am worried about money.
And look at my hair! My hair is terrible! Your hair is terrible, but so was mine.
And I fixed it using product.
I love that you have big dreams, but I don't want to lose everything, Louis.
Let's just go home.
- We can't do that.
- Why? What's so important we had to move here and change our whole lives? Sorry to interrupt, Mr.
Huang.
The burro is ready for blocking.
Thank you, Nancy.
We'll discuss this later.
Oh, cool.
You got turkey and cheese lunchables? I got pizza.
Yo, man! What you doing?! Get used to it.
You're the one at the bottom now.
No, I'm not! Yeah, you are! It's my turn, chink! And according to the lunch monitor, he kicked him in the groinal area, shoved pudding in his face, and unleashed a stream of obscenities I can't repeat because God is listening.
There were some words he used that I've never heard before, and I grew up in Boston.
This is a very serious offense, Mr.
and Mrs.
Huang.
Yes, it is.
We are very upset.
That you didn't do anything to defend Eddie.
Excuse me? That boy called our son a chink.
You think that's okay? Why didn't you do anything about that? How come only Eddie's out there?! How come that boy is not also out there?! Where are his parents?! Or his 40-year-old best friend? And why aren't we talking about the fact that he has a - The school's fine with that? - Fishy.
I don't think you understand.
We're talking about possible suspension.
If you try to suspend our son because of this, we will sue everyone in this school.
So fast, it'll make your head spin.
Hey, it's the American way, right? You know about that.
- Oh, I, um, have a coupon for you.
- Oh, yes.
It's a restaurant called Cattleman's ranch.
Special.
You get a free onion blossom with the purchase of any entree, but you have to buy a drink.
W-why did you stand up for me? You do your best not to make waves, but I will never be mad at you for standing up for yourself.
This is why.
This is why what? This is why we moved here.
I'm sorry for what happened to Eddie, but it's going to make him stronger.
In fact, us coming to this new place is going to make us all stronger.
I came down here, and I opened a wild west restaurant because this is the wild west a lawless land for only the bravest of families! There is opportunity here to make a better life for our family.
I don't want to work for your brother forever.
No.
Me? I got big dreams.
I got big plans.
Things were okay for us back in D.
C.
, but I want more than okay for us.
You're just trying to get a nut, dad.
I want more than okay for us, too.
I am with you.
Nut for me, also.
But this is not the west.
This is the south.
If we want to go west, we should go to California.
Do you know how expensive California is? This is west for us.
This is fine.
When you live in a lunchables world, it's not always easy being homemade chinese food.
But it's also what makes you special.
My family was gonna create their place in Orlando, and we're gonna do it our way, because you don't have to pretend to be someone else in order to belong.
Yeah, son.
A little bit of respect.
like B.
I.
G.
Said, if you don't know, now you know.
Hey, y'all.
When my neck gets red 'cause of my white skin is out in the yellow sun, I like to come here to Cattleman's ranch, Where I can get comfortable along people of my own kind.
Maybe meet my wife or my cousin.
Or my cousin's wife.
For an onion blossom for only 2.

Tell them I send you.
Who am I? Cattleman Mitch.
And his pal Eric the donkey.
I think we really have something here.",success
41,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"This job is eating me alive.
I can't breathe anymore.
I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat.
I'm not becoming like them.
I am them.
Hey! What are you doing, weirdo? I'm doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco.
Or actually, ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco.
What's up? Get it together, man.
Okay? So the store was hit about two hours ago.
They took mostly tablets, laptops, and cameras.
Sorry.
I'd like a list of all your employees, whoever had access to the store.
I'd also like to apologize for my partner.
His parents didn't give him enough attention.
Uh, Detective I already solved the case.
We're looking for three white males, one of whom has sleeve tats on both arms.
And how do you know that? I had an informant on the inside.
He's been here for years.
Watching, learning.
Waiting.
His code name? Fuzzy Cuddle bear.
He's a nanny cam.
You got lucky.
No, I got here five minutes before you and figured that in this gigantic electronics store, there had to be at least one working camera.
Oh! Hi, bad guys! You did it, fuzzy.
You busted 'em.
It's time to come home.
I'm not sure if I can.
I've been undercover so long, I've forgotten who I am.
I have seen terrible things.
I haven't known the touch of a woman in many moons.
All right.
Detective Santiago! Don't walk away from me! Yes, I did crack the case.
So, Santiago, would you do the honors? Ohhh! I hate this! Ah, yeah.
I hate this.
And you're just gonna add one.
I'm winning.
It's a good feeling.
It's a good feeling.
Yeah.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
I will! JP, update on the Morgenthau murder? Yeah! Good news for all you murder fans.
Earlier this morning Someone decided to shoot and kill luxury food importer Henry Morgenthau.
Body was found by the cleaning lady, during her interview, I deduced, using expert Detective work, that she had something super gross on her chin.
I think it was flan.
Charles thinks it was flan.
I think it was butterscotch pudding.
Maybe it was just old person gunk.
You know how old people always have that gunk on them.
Oldie gunk.
Could be, yeah.
Anyone else? How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk? Crime techs are at the scene now.
We're heading back when they're done.
Okay, I want you on this.
It's gonna be priority one for the new C.
O.
Wait, tell us about the new Captain.
Captain Holt will be here soon.
He'll wanna introduce himself.
Dismissed.
Hey, Gina.
You know any scalpers? I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out.
Okay, two points to make here.
First, Rihanna You And then Rihanna.
Yeah.
What's your second point? She's got a type.
Which is really anyone but you.
Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too.
Look, a Rihanna concert's a pretty big swing, man.
- I don't know.
- She's into watching old movies.
Cool.
Where would I find a place that shows old movies? Oh, yeah, just go on the Internet and search for the phrase ""I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who doesn't like me.
"" - Great.
Thank you.
- Good.
Hey, you heard anything about the new Captain? Uh, no, and I don't care.
I just wish Captain McGintley never left, he was the best.
He was terrible.
You just liked him 'cause he let you do anything you wanted.
On your marks, get set Go.
What the hell's going on around here? Fire extinguisher roller chair derby? Okay.
And go! Yeah! What's your point? If I'm ever gonna make Captain, I need a good mentor.
I need my rabbi.
Sorry, dude But this new guy's gonna be another washed-up pencil pusher who's only concerned with Following every rule in the patrol guide.
Meep morp zeep.
Robot Captain Engage.
- Is that what you think? - He-hey! New Captain alert.
You must be the new C.
O.
I'm Detective Jake Peralta.
Great to meet you.
Now don't let me interrupt.
You were describing what kind of person I'm gonna be.
I'd like you to finish.
That's not necessary.
Or I could recap very quickly, sure.
Um, let's see.
I think I said some joke about being a washed-up pencil pusher.
- Now do the robot voice.
- Which The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot.
I wanna hear it again.
Meep morp zarp.
Robot.
- That's a terrible robot voice.
- Yep.
The next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie.
Oh, actually, the last Captain didn't care if we wore ties.
Well, your new Captain does.
And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders.
Everyone, I'm your new commanding officer, - Captain Ray Holt.
- Speech! - That was my speech.
- Short and sweet.
- Sergeant Jeffords, a word.
- Yes, sir.
I love that guy.
Same! He's so suave.
Does anyone get a little bit of a gay vibe? No? Okay.
Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me Though you were significantly Fatter, sir.
They called me ""Terry Titties.
"" Because I had large, uh Titties, yes.
I remember.
I never liked that nickname.
Though to be fair, it was accurate.
What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave? A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls.
Cagney and Lacey.
They have adorable chubby cheeks.
Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt.
Lost my edge.
There was an incident in a department store.
Hey, man, you okay? You look a little jumpy.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Ahhh! I think he's dead.
And I'm still not right.
Tell me about your Detective squad.
Um Well, Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels.
They're pretty much worthless, but they make good coffee.
Copy that.
Now the good ones.
Rosa Diaz.
Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary.
Tell me who has me for secret santa.
No! That takes all the fun out of it.
It's Scully.
He got you a scarf.
- I'll make him return it.
- Yes, you will.
Charles Boyle.
He's a grinder.
Not the most brilliant Detective, but he works harder than anyone else.
He's not physically gifted.
Oh, man! My muffin.
Ahh! Oh, my head! My muffin, my head! And I stepped on the On my muffin! And my head and my muffin.
Amy Santiago.
She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough.
Careful.
That stuff's pretty hot.
Oh, is it? Hmm? She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year.
Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up.
Tell me about Peralta.
Jacob Peralta is my best Detective.
He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles.
The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.
That was very well put.
I've talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.
Look, you know my history.
You know how important this is to me.
This precinct is doing fine, but I wanna make it the best one in Brooklyn.
And I need your help.
Absolutely, sir.
Where do we start? What is happening? We start with him.
Okay, so the perp came in through the window, left the muddy red footprint, and apparently had sex with the dish rack.
Shell casing found here.
Two shots.
Bang, bang.
Great work, Detective.
You get a tie.
Hey, that's mine.
You took it from my desk.
That's right, Charles.
Good solve.
- Tie for you.
- Thanks! Now everyone be sure to put those on because it's impossible to solve crimes - unless you're wearing a tie.
- Lay off the Captain.
That man is gonna be my rabbi.
Okay, first of all, when you use the word ""rabbi,"" you know that turns me on and that's unfair in the work environment.
Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass.
Yeah, he's a little too serious.
- What do you think, Rosa? - He seems cool.
Yeah, he seems cool.
I agree.
Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon Iberico ham, valued at what! $6,000.
$6,000 for a ham? Jamon Iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain.
They had it at my uncle's funeral.
I gorged myself at that funeral.
I mean, I was constipated for three days.
Wow, that's a great story, Charles, thank you.
All right, listen up, everybody.
Better contact Captain Holt, let him know we got a ten-tie situation.
Speaking of ties, where's yours, meep morp? This is fantastic.
Captain! Hey! Welcome to the murder.
What are you doing here? I like to know what my detectives are up to.
- That okay by you? - Yep.
Take Santiago and knock on doors.
See if the neighbors heard anything.
Door duty? It's a waste of time.
Diaz and Boyle.
Check in the coroner.
Report back to me in an hour.
- That went well.
- No, it didn't.
He's got like super hearing.
Hey, Rosa! Rosa.
Rosa! Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week.
Wanna go? Sure.
Cool! Awesome.
There's a bunch of movie options.
I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.
Citizen Kane is terrible.
Pick a good movie.
Good call.
Smart.
I'll do it.
I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.
So Gina Civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground.
What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs? I will tell you on six conditions.
Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves.
Second How about this? - If you tell me - Mm-hmm.
I won't have you suspended Without pay.
Oh, that sounds great.
Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car.
It's an old Mustang, and it's pretty sweet.
If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him.
He guarantees it will end in sex.
I bet on at least some over-the-clothes action.
At the very least, some touching - No, that's enough, Gina.
- Caresses.
I could see him showing up in a silk robe.
- That's enough, Gina.
- All right.
Thank you.
Let the wasting of time begin.
Hello, sir.
Can we ask you a few questions? Definitely.
Yeah.
I'm actually I'm super glad you guys are here right now.
Are you smelling that weed smell? Yeah.
'Cause a dude broke in, smoked weed, and bolted.
It's Do you think it's the same dude that left that bong there on the floor? Yes.
Police! - Hello.
- Hello.
What's your name? - My name? - Mm-hmm.
- Mlepnos.
- Can you spell that, please? M-l-e-p Clay.
Did you say ""Clay""? Yes, the ""Clay"" is silent.
All right, got it.
Have you seen this man before? He was shot last night.
Oh.
Thank you.
No, sir, that's ours.
We need that.
- We - And he kept it.
Wall Street journal on the doormat Top floor apartment.
like a hot, eligible bachelor.
I'll take that action.
Police! Open up! Hello.
Oh! Hello, sir! How are you today? I am Detective Right-All-The-Time, and this is my partner Detective Terrible Detective.
No surprises from the coroner.
A few gunshots, shoulder and chest.
None of the neighbors heard or saw anything.
And what's worse, Santiago struck out with a 92-year-old.
That is not accurate, sir.
Wait, you hooked up with him? Ugh! All right, hit the pawn shops and canvass the neighborhood.
And while you're out, you can buy yourself a tie.
Oh, actually, sir I'm wearing a tie right now.
Check it out.
Secret tie.
First of all, I think you're kind of overdoing it with the manscaping.
But more importantly, Detective, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously? Does anyone here know why it's so important to me that you all dress appropriately? Hmm.
Four highly trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery.
I wanna be briefed on any new developments.
Any questions? I was gonna ask you if you thought I was doing too much manscaping, but we solved that one.
So I'm good.
Hey, Boyle.
- Yep.
- What about this fancy ham stuff? - Jamon Iberico.
- Yes.
The perp left a really expensive TV but then stole ham? It doesn't make sense.
Is there a place nearby the crime scene that sells it? - Beneficio's might.
- Let's go.
You gotta brief the C.
O.
first.
We'll brief him after we catch the guy.
My name is Ratko.
I don't know anything.
Oh, okay.
You recognize this guy? - Henry Morgenthau? - No.
Maybe actually look at the picture.
I don't know him.
I don't know what happened.
No more questions.
Well, why don't I run a scenario past you, Ratko, and you tell me what you think? You do know Morgenthau.
He came in here and tried to sell you some hams.
You knew they were worth a lotta money, so you tried to steal them from him when he wasn't home.
Only he was home, so you shot him.
Does that sound familiar? Uh, maybe some role play will jog your memory? - Great idea.
- Okay, yeah.
Okay.
- So I'm I'm Ratko.
- No, no, I'm Ratko.
Come on.
I'm always the victim.
Look, I'm doing this with you right here.
Fine, fine.
Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams.
Don't I know you from the grocery store? Kill! And scene.
NYPD! Everyone down! Ma'am, if you could just get down, or ignore me and continue shopping.
- Boyle, get the door! - On it! Ratko! Oh! Ow! Ha ha ha! Ow, Ratko, ow! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ratko! I'm getting mad! That's a waste of manchego! Charles! - How are you still here? - Jake! Little help! Ratko! He's not going anywhere, Jake! Ratko! I got him! I got him! Don't worry! So no, I did not brief you.
And yes, he did get away.
But some bonus good news I got you hazelnut.
And A little spoon there for you.
Is he seriously assigning me to the records room? I mean, why do we even have a records room? Computer's been invented, right? I didn't dream it? You're lucky, man.
I wish I could get assigned here full-time.
You could not be farther from the action.
Sergeant, you know me.
I have more arrests than anyone.
Will you please tell the Captain how dumb it is to lock his best Detective in a file cabinet? - Second best.
- You're wrong about Holt.
That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know.
In 1981, he caught the disco strangler.
It's over, disco man! Put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl.
Wow.
The man is the real deal.
You need to listen to him.
Gonna be hard to win our bet when you're on the bench, Peralta.
Although I did start a new category.
""Murderers we let go.
"" And look at that.
You're winning.
Have fun with your files.
Yeah, you know what, I will have fun with my files.
Have fun with your face! Slam! That was a slam.
So what movie did you get us tickets to? Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them.
Just to be safe? What does that mean? I don't know, I didn't wanna mess up.
Because you're sort of Opinionated.
You think I'm opinionated? Okay, here's an opinion for you.
You're a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit.
So we can go see North by Northwest.
We're not seeing a movie together.
Good call.
Smart.
Keep it profesh.
- Hey, Captain.
- So you found something? Hey, I like the tie.
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Anyway, I think I got something good here.
Turns out the name ""Ratko"" is made up.
But I was digging through these files One of which I literally found in a spider web And it turns out there were a bunch of references to a serbian thug, street names ""the rat"" and ""the butcher,"" who's known to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum Park, which has red soil, hence, the muddy red footprint on Morgenthau's counter.
That's fine work, Detective.
Thank you very much, sir.
Testament to what can be achieved when you dress appropriately.
Let's pound it out.
You know what, such fine police work, let's share it with the whole team.
Santiago! Boyle! Diaz! Get in here! Bring everyone! And a camera! That's not necessary.
Oh, they're here! Of the fine master Detective, Jake Peralta.
Yeah, let's have a hand, everyone.
- Give him a hand.
- Yeah, nice! Looking good! Yeah.
Thank you.
No record of Ratko on the ledger.
Must've used cash.
Well, I, for one, am just pumped to be on a stakeout with you, Captain.
You know what my favorite thing about stakeouts is? Patrol guide says ""no dress code.
"" So I'm just the zip-up hoodie and my two best friends.
Does he always talk this much? I just tune it out.
It's like a white noise machine.
Okay, first of all, that's racist.
Secondly, Captain, Terry told me you caught the disco strangler.
That's incredible.
I've read that case.
With all due respect, sir, why'd it take you so long to get your first command? Because I'm gay.
Ah.
Seriously? I'm surprised you didn't know.
I don't try to hide it.
Did anyone else get a little bit of a gay vibe? Manscaping.
Damn! I am not a good Detective.
Here.
I feel bad that you spent all that money on the movie tickets.
Why don't you just go to the movies with me? Nope.
Okay.
Well, this is awkward.
It's not awkward.
I like your company.
You're sweet.
When did you come out? About 25 years ago.
The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay Detective.
But then the old guard died out.
Suddenly, they couldn't wait to show off the fact that they had a highly ranking gay officer.
I made Captain.
But they put me in a public affairs unit.
I was a good soldier.
I helped recruitment.
But all I ever really wanted was my own command.
And now I finally got it.
And I'm not gonna screw it up.
Captain, I'm sorry.
I I feel like a jackass.
But on the flip side, there's Ratko.
Humility over.
I'm amazing! Fantastic.
Looks like we all got door duty.
Ah, yeah.
From before.
Good one.
You look great.
Clear.
Clear.
Okay.
Unbelievable! Un-believable! Ah.
Ratko, great to see you.
You can't stop me.
I'm going.
Actually, you're not going anywhere.
'Cause if you take a look to your left, you'll see Detective's Boyle and Diaz.
Right there is Detective Santiago.
And behind you is Captain Holt.
Point is My team has you surrounded.
Oh, my God, I just got the tie thing! Captain, I just figured it out.
Maybe now's not the best time, Detective.
It's a uniform! We're a team, and the tie is a part of that team's uniform, right? You ask Ratko what team? No, Ratko, shut up.
It's important to you because you were kept off the team for so long.
And now you're the coach, and you want us to all wear that same uniform.
Boom! Nailed it! Yes, you did.
Now just arrest Ratko.
All right, Ratko, down.
Drop the weapon.
Hands on your head.
Here we go.
- Hey! - He's running! Oh! Got him! Hands behind your back! Hands behind your back! Stay down.
That's how we do it in the nine-nine, sir.
Catch bad guys and look good doing it.
What's wrong with you? Never took off the speedo.
Big mistake.
It is inside me.
Great work, team!",success
42,Everybody Hates Chris,"dfdsf1982.
That was the year I turned 13.
Before I was a comedian, I thought the coolest thing that would happen to me was being a teenager.
I was gonna have women, money, stay out late.
I thought it was gonna be the bomb.
'sup? Chris! Chris! Chris! Boy, was I wrong! Chris! Get in the bathroom and wipe the pee off the toilet seat! Disgusting! When I was 13, my mother convinced my father to move us out of the Project.
She always said Project is just another word for experiment.
In a lab, the government gives rats cheese.
In the Projetcs, the governement gives people cheese.
Dad, can we stop at McDonald's? You guys have MacDonald's money? Julius, the kids have to eat.
They ain't got to eat MacDonald's.
We got some beloni in the back.
I'll pull over.
My father Julius always kept beloni handy just in case.
We get one combo meal.
Drew gets the burger, Tonya gets the fries, Chris you can have the drink.
One time I just got ice.
We moved to an apartment in Bedstyle, Brookyn.
Now had we known that Bedstyle would be the center of a crack epidemic, I guess we'd have picked some place else.
Bedstyle even had its own motto: ""Bedstyle, do or die"" Look at that! Look at that! Those were some of the guys that were gonna die.
If I ever catch any of y'all spray painting on anybody's wall, I'm gonna put my foot so far up your behind, you'll have toes for teeth.
Get inside.
That's my mother Rochelle.
She had a hundred recipes for whooping ass.
Boy, I will slap the caps off your knees.
I will knock you into last night.
I will slap your name out the phonebook and call my Bell and tell I didn't.
That's my younger brother Drew.
There's nothing worse than having a little brother that's bigger than you.
My sister Tonya was the youngest and would do anything to get me in trouble.
Chris, clean that mess up.
- Tonya did it.
- Huh-uh! Did I ask you that? Since I was the oldest, I had to be the emergency adult.
If you smell smoke, and you think the house is gonna catch fire, get your brother and your sister and get out of here.
If you smell gaz and you think the house is gonna blow up, get your brother and your sister and get out of here.
If you smell smoke, and your brother catches on fire, get your sister and get out of here.
Fortunately, the house never caught fire and neither did my brother.
Mom, why is it that Drew and Tonya get to go to school in our own neighborhood but I have to go all way out to Brooklyn Beach? Brooklyn Beach was a poor italian neighborhood on the other side of town.
It was just like Bedstyle, take away the gangs, add the mob.
Because the junior high school around here is like a hoodlum factory.
And those white kids, they get an education.
Not a Harvard type education, just a not-sticking-up-a-liquor-store type education.
Hey, dad.
Hey, baby.
What's up, dad? Hey, daddy.
Hey, baby.
Tonya was my father's favorite.
What's wrong with your oatmeal? Chris made it too lumpy.
And she knew it.
You don't have to eat it I know you're not gonna threw that away.
Eat that.
That's 30 cent worth of oatmeal.
My father always knew what everything costs.
That's a dollar 9 cent in the trash.
That's 2 dollars on fire.
That's 49 cent of spilled milk dripping all over my table.
Somebody's gonna drink this milk.
Baby did you see this? I've paid this.
- It says you paid half.
- I know.
I gave you all the money how come you only paid half the bill.
I cannot even believe that you'd ask me that.
Just asking you a question.
I'm trying to find out what's going on around here.
No, you're not.
You're questioning my judgement.
You act like there's not a big red bill sitting on the table.
Okay, fine.
You do it then.
- I will.
- Okay.
- I am.
- Good.
- Fine.
- Fine.
My parents taught me love is never having to say ""kiss my ass"".
Where the stamps at? I was never cool growing up.
The coolest thing about me was this pair of white sneakers I had.
No, no, no, no.
Boy, you're not going to school in no sneakers.
Believe it or not, there was a time where you couldn't wear sneakers everywhere.
Why? Everybody else wears sneakers.
Because you look raggity.
Plus, you have an assembly today.
Boy, you're gonna lost your mind.
My mother hated raggity.
She always said it's better to be poor and neat than rich and raggity.
I think she said that because we were poor.
Here.
Wear Drew's good shoes.
I hate these shoes.
And everybody will make fun of me at school.
You've only been going there for a week.
You don't know everybody.
I was the only black kid at the school.
They know me.
This is so embarassing.
How come he's wearing my shoes? Because you only have one pair of feet.
but, Chris, don't fool around after school.
I need you to be here to let Drew and Tonya in, okay? You won't be here? No, I gotta work today.
But you know the drill.
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
Daddy's gonna be asleep and don't wake him up 'til 5 o'clock.
That's right.
Chris! You got your bus pass? Yeah, um - Somewhere around here - Hmm-hm.
You keep on.
You lose this bus pass and your behind is gonna be walking to school.
- Here's 2 dollars for lunch.
- Thanks.
All right, now be good.
- Bye, mom.
- Bye, mommy.
Bye, baby.
Hold your sister's hand.
Now go in the street.
Keisha was the girl next door.
At 13, I didn't know a lot about sex.
But I knew she had something to do with it.
Hey, Drew! Drew? What's up, Keisha? You know her? Yeah.
Drew was so cool he got girls at 10 that I couldn't get until I was 30.
Listen, when y'all get to the house, don't ring the bell or knock on the door.
Just wait, okay? Whatever.
What if I have to go to the bathroom? Go at school.
That bathroom is so nasty.
Listen You wake up daddy, he's gonna punch me square in the face, and if he does that, I'm gonna punch you in the face and then he's gonna kill me and wound up in jail.
Now do you want daddy to go to jail? No.
No? Alright then.
Even when my mother got mad, she still made my dad's dinner.
on my mind.
Vegetables, patatoes and its favorite: a big piece of chicken.
I had to take two buses to school everyday.
Was the junior high school across the street really that bad? Like rock 'n roll, school shootings were also invented by blacks and stolen by the white man.
My first bus was the 26.
I read the newspaper every single day.
I learnt more in the way to school than I learnt at school.
My next bus was the 44.
I was the only black person on the bus.
And nobody was sitting next to me.
I mean nobody.
If you think she's mad now, wait 'til her daughter brings home O.
J.
My mother thought going to a white school meant I would get a better education and I would be safer.
Wrong! That's Joey Caruso.
A little thug with a big chip on his shoulder.
You know I manage to avoid him before I wore these shoes.
Nice shoes, Bojangles.
Bojangles? That's not what your mother call me when I was tap dancing with her draws last night.
I know you think I'm crazy.
But if I let him get away with that, he'd be doing it all year.
Now I couldn't beat him, but I thought maybe I could outblack him.
- What? - Did I stutter? You know who I am? You step on my shoe again and I'm gonna tell you who I am.
I don't play that.
I'm from Bedstyle, boy.
I bring half a marcy up in here.
I will beat your butt so bad.
You're gonna need crutches in your sleep.
Hey, this might work.
You know what else I'm gonna do? What's your name? Chris.
I'm Dr.
Raymond your new principle.
Now get off my feet.
That's funny? That's not funny.
What's your name, son? Caruso.
Fix yourself up next time you come to my school.
See those shoes? They say something.
They say I'm a student, I want to learn.
I want more of that.
And less of this.
Don't bump into me again.
Even though Caruso was messing with me, getting embarrassed made him even madder.
So you know what's coming next This isn't over, nigger! He got away with calling me nigger that day.
The later in life he said it at a DMX concert and almost got stomped to death.
You're really from ""Bedstyle do or die""? Yeah.
You've ever been shot.
No.
At least not yet.
- I'm Greg.
- I'm Chris.
Greg wasn't my first choice for a friend.
But mutual ass kicking seem to bring people together.
- Cool shoes.
- Thanks.
If that was the new principle, who was the old one? I didn't touch her! I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr.
Palmer was accused of doing something that we can't tell you about because of the network sensus.
The school settled the lawsuit out of court and he's not allowed to teach anymore.
If he moves to your neighborhood, you'll get a warning.
Back at home, my father should have been in bed.
But he'd rather lose sleep than money.
What are you doing? I'm paying the bills.
See, it says 40 dollars, I'm paying 40 dollars.
And that's exactly why I don't let you pay the bills.
- Where are you going? - To work! Is Chris gonna be home in time to wake me up? Can I see in the future? What's wrong with you? Probably can see in the future! By lunch time, I was starving.
I'm gonna go get a hotdog.
I'm gonna get a slice of pizza.
Give me back my bus pass.
You want it, take it you little After school, Satchmo.
After school, I had a plan.
This is crazy! Man, it's a school fight.
School fights only last a minute because somebody always comes and breaks them up.
All I have to do is get in the first punch.
Somebody will stop it.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! What are you waiting for Cornbread! This should be over any minute! Somebody's gonna stop this! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait for me! Thank you! Thank you! Yeah Come on, 'mam! Come on! I've got a schedule.
Wait! Hold on, please! There's a kid trying to catch you.
Yeah, I know.
I see.
Wait! Wait! Wait! I bet you don't get me tomorrow.
I bet I do.
You do? I gotta close now.
Cut that out, you bunch of hoots! Back off! I was still hungry but I was almost home.
What could go wrong now? Dad! Dad! Dad! That girl is trying to get me killed.
Dad! Da Girl, you want daddy to go to jail? I told her to quit.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I told you to go at school.
That bathroom is nasty.
Listen, we're going in.
But once we get in, I don't wanna hear any noise.
None.
Do you understand? Yes.
My father always slept in his uniform.
That way when he woke up, he'd be ready to go.
gonna pay bills.
I'll pay the bills.
You may not think messing up a pair of 40 dollars shoes is such a big deal, but you have to realize that my father's car only cost 65 dollars.
I had to get those shoes clean.
For the first time that day, things were going allright.
All I had to do now was keep everybody quiet 'til 5 o'clock.
Dad.
Dad.
Time to get up.
It's 5 o'clock? Yep.
It's not 4:59? Nop.
Which job am I going to? You're driving a truck.
Hello.
Hey, baby.
It's mommy.
Is your father up? - Yep.
- Good, good, good.
Take his plate out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven for him.
What plate? The one with the big piece of chicken.
Haven't I told you ""do not eat the big piece of chicken""? But I was still hungry.
My mother wasn't really mad at me, she was looking out for my father.
You see how big he is.
She didn't want him to go to work hungry.
Because if he goes to work hungry then he'll be grouchy.
And if he's grouchy, he might call his boss Cracker.
And if he calls his boss Cracker then we'll live in the Projects again.
But do not eat the biggest piece of chicken.
Do you understand? At least, you didn't mess up these school shoes.
Come over here and give me some sugar.
Now go to bed.
- Rochelle.
- What? Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
But I'm working hard trying to pay for this place, you know that.
Julius, just because you make money doesn't mean you know how to spend it.
You gotta know how to work the system.
- What system? - The debt system.
I run this house like they run the country on a deficit.
Rent is due on the 3rd, I don't pay 'til the 9th because you don't get your check 'til the 7th.
If you pay the light bill now, I won't have money for the groceries, the rent will be late and then you'll have to work overtime.
You want to work overtime again, Julius? No, I don't think so.
If we don't owe people money, we won't have any money at all.
Um why didn't you just say that then? Because you didn't ask.
Baby Don't baby me.
Come here.
I'm sorry, okay? Who told you to open the mail anyway? Come here, Pooky.
Last time you said Pooky I got pregnant.
You're my Pooky.

No Pooky.

My dad always checked on us in between jobs: his night job and his late at night job.
Dad? Hey, man.
I thought you were asleep.
I'm sorry I ate the big piece of chicken.
That was 89 cent worth of chicken.
What? You didn't get enough to eat at school? I was still hungry.
Now I'm still hungry.
Look, next time, eat a little some extra breakfast, okay? Okay.
Here.
And don't go pulling this money out.
somebody'd try to rob you.
Don't tell your mother about this.
Everything okay at school? I didn't tell him about the fight.
My dad went to school during the civil rights era.
After hoses, tanks and a dog bites on your ass, somehow Joey Caruso didn't compare.
Yeah, it was alright.
Okay.
I'll see you in the morning.
My father wasn't the type to say ""I love you"".
He was one of four fathers on the block.
""I'll see you in the morning"" mean he was coming home.
Coming home was his way of saying ""I love you"".

- I'll go get the coffee.
What do you guys want? - Dude, sit down.
Okay? Wait till the waitress comes out here, and then you can stare at her.
- I wasn't gonna stare at her.
I was just gonna - He wasn't gonna stare at her.
- You're totally obsessed with that chick.
- No, I'm not.
I like her.
I have a little bit of a crush, yes.
But obsessed? That's a bit of a harsh word.
- It's never gonna happen.
- Honestly, I think we should think about hiring Terrell.
- Why? For what? - You heard him.
When he's promotin', everybody named Mama's looking to get in.
That's true.
They do have ""niggers hanging from rafters.
"" - Wow.
Nice.
- No, that's not what I was saying.
- Coffee? - Yeah.
- Hitler? - No, I'm not I'm not Adolf Hitler.
- I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.
- I was quoting a black friend.
Okay.
Well, that's just great.
- Now she thinks I'm racist.
- Dude, will you just drop it? Listen, ifTerrell delivers half of what he promises, we're looking at 200 people.
- Yeah, that's true.
- It'd be nice to get some chicks in the bar.
All right, let's do it.
- Sure about this? - It's 2005, Charlie.
Don't you think it's ridiculous that you have no friends outside of your own race? - No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.
- It's not stupid! - It's a stupid plan.
- It's not This is a college campus.
This is a great place to meet people of different cultures, diversify You're just trying to make black Mm-hmm.
You're trying to make black friends.
- You're not making it easy.
- You're trying to impress Terrell with a couple of black friends.
Don't do this right now.
Okay.
See? This is exactly what I'm talking about.
- This is perfect.
- Huh.
Yeah.
- I'm gonna break the ice.
- Go for it.
'Bout to bust that shit up, Reese.
'Bout to bust that shit up, boy! Absolutely.
- Okay, that didn't go exactly the way - No.
- No.
It was really awkward.
- Really awkward.
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah! - Hey, what's your name? - Oh.
It's, uh, Charlie.
Do you play bones, Charlie? I dabble.
Do you want to play? I could get you a game.
Uh, no, I shouldn't.
I'm not very good, so - I bet you're really good.
- Well, it's been a long time, you know.
- Oh, come on.
- All right.
One game.
Domino, bitch! This is bullshit.
Absolute bullshit.
- Why do these people like you more than they like me? - Maybe it's comments like that.
I meant those people in there, not all black people.
What am I supposed to say? You should say something different.
Figure something else out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Um, I'm Janell.
- Oh, hi.
- Uh, you got some moves out there, Charlie.
- Thanks.
You know.
I wanted to give you this.
- Oh.
Okay.
- You know? - Give me a call sometime.
All right? - Yeah.
Sure.
Well, you - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing, dude? - What? That girl's gorgeous.
She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're not racist.
She probably has friends for me.
Well, if anything, I think we should be focused on black men, first of all.
What? We don't really need We need black guys, so - Black guys? What are you talking about? - You know.
Is this about that waitress at the coffee shop, dude? - Oh, my God! - What? - Dude, you are obsessed with this chick.
- No, I'm not.
- Let me see your wallet.
- Why? - Are you still carrying a picture of her in your wallet? - No.
Give it to me.
Give it Oh, my God! Stop making a scene! Just give me the wallet! Give me the wallet! I can't get the goddamn It's okay! It's okay, everybody! - You're making a scene.

I'll call the black girl.
Okay? Okay, buddy.
We're cool.
We're cool.
We're good.
Thanks, guys.
See ya.
I had the craziest dream last night that I was in Cleveland, Ohio which is really weird, because I've never even been to Ohio.
This guy was wearing a bunny suit, and he was coming out You know what, Dee? I don't wanna hear about your dreams.
Okay? I hate listening to people's dreams.
It's like flipping through a stack of photographs.
If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's having sex, I just I don't care.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I would listen to your dreams.
- 'Cause your my brother and I love you.
- I'm sorry.
I am.
- Hey! What's goin' on, guys? - Terrell.
- How are you? - Hey! What's up? What's up? How you doin'? Dennis! What's goin' on? - All right, man.
- How's it goin', man? Good, man.
Listen, um, you mind stepping outside with me for a second, man? - Yeah, I'll come outside.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
- All right.
Well, come on.
I'm gonna put these out on the tables.
Rule number one: Always keep a line.
Oh, my God! That is a lot of people! Wow! - This is crazy! - I know! I told you! Terrell's the best! I'm gonna have to start bartending full-time.
L-Look at this! - Why are you making more money than me? - I don't know! - Hey, this is crazy! - I know.
Terrell packed 'em in.
Look at this.
- This is crazy! - Yeah, dude, we were just saying that.
- Lot of dudes.
- Yeah, there's a lot of dudes.
Lot of dudes.
What can I get you boys? - Oh, uh, we wanted to wait for the cute one.
- What cute one? Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett by the jukebox? - Oh, yeah! - Let's go say hey.
- Yo, Brettie boy! - Hey, cuz! - Hey! How you doin'? - What's up, Brett? Can you believe this crowd? - Oh, it's something else! - Yeah! Gentlemen, I understand my services have been requested.
I actually got a couple of services I'd like to request.
Whoa! Uh, what are you doin, man? I'm not - You have the most beautiful eyes.
- Okay, man, but I'm Really? So blue.
Really more of a blue-green, actually, but - I'm really proud of you, man.
- Yeah, thanks.
- You've come a long way.
- What do you mean? You guys are running the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
No! What in the hell is your problem? How could you not tell me you were gay? I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia.
I didn't think it was that big a secret.
I've been coming on to you for weeks now.
- Just thought you were into gay dudes.
- I am not into gay dudes! - Apparently you are.
- Okay, well, you know what? The guys hired you to promote their bar, and you turned it into a gay bar.
They are not happy.
- So much money! - Whoo! Oh! So much money! We made more money in one night Th-Than in the entire time that we've owned this place! We have to embrace the situation.
We should totally embrace the situation! - We're a gay bar from now on.
- Absolutely, man! No goddamn way.
Have you guys seen this? ""Looking for that new hot spot to spot that stud? Well, Paddy's Irish Pub has plugged that hole.
"" - That's a nice notice.
- No, it's not nice.
I don't want to be plugging anybody's holes.
- I'm gonna have to agree with Mac.
- Of course you are.
I made $300 last night.
How much did you make? First of all, that's rude.
And that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
It has everything to do with it.
I don't think we have much of a choice.
We need to do this.
If you guys remember, one of the major reasons we got this bar was to get laid.
Maybe you did it to get laid.
I got a little something I like to call business ethics.
Business ethics? The only reason you don't care is you have black girls hanging all over you.
Okay, chill out.
You're gonna screw it up.
Screw it up? I happen to have a date with a nice young lady today.
- Ouch.
- It's a purely fiscal decision.
Oh, bullshit.
You don't care about the money.
You just like the attention.
- What the hell is that supposed to mean? - ""Everybody look at me!"" You know exactly what I mean, pretty boy.
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, hoss.
- I just get along really well with those guys.
- They're vibing.
No, you're leading them on.
You're not gay, you're just really vain.
Okay, time out.
Here's what we should do.
Let's take a vote.
- Fine.
- Okay.
All those in favor of Paddy's Pub remaining a gay bar, say ""aye.
"" - Aye.
- Aye.
Opposed? - K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.
- Why? - Because you're the bartender.
You're not one of the owners.
- No, Sweet Dee gets a vote.
- No, she doesn't! - Of course I get a vote! All owners opposed, say ""nay.
"" All people who own the bar who are opposed, say ""nay.
"" All people who own the bar who are opposed say ""nay.
"" Nay.
- Two against one! Oh, well.
- Ohh! Paddy's Irish Pub will henceforth remain the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
- Hey-hey! What's going on? - Hey! - Look at you! You look good! - Oh, thank you.
That's so sweet.
- So, where we going? - Well, I thought we'd go grab a drink.
- Oh, I want one so bad.
- All righty! Oh, a coffee shop.
I thought you meant, like, a drink at a bar.
Yeah, absolutely.
Uh, why don't you have a seat here.
I'll go get the coffee.
What would you like? - I don't really drink coffee.
Let me see.
- Totally.
What do you want, Charlie? ""What do you want, Charlie?"" I'd like you to take a look at the lovely young African-American woman sitting at the table over there.
Okay.
That woman is my friend.
Wow.
Good for you.
So, the other day when you heard me saying something about certain people hanging from said rafters I was quoting a friend of mine who also happens What are you trying to say? Spit it out.
Well, now that you know that I'm not racist, you and I could maybe go on Dude, N-O.
- How many times do I have to say it to you? - One time is fine.
- Apparently one time is not fine.
- One time per time I ask you.
Hey, what's going on up here? Oh, not too much.
Charlie's using you to prove that he's not racist.
Then he asked me out on a date.
Charlie, is this true? Would that upset you if it was something that was true? - You need to see a doctor.
This thing looks really bad.
- I did! - What'd he say? - He said thatJanell punched me in my eye! All right, well, you need to keep that i - Wait.
Her name's Janell? - Yeah.
JanellJenkins.
She's got a hell of a right hand.
She also said if she ever saw me again, she was going to slit my throat.
Are you two seeing this? Boys are out tonight, huh? This is unbelievable.
What is going on here? You got black women crawling all over you and this Mary here is the belle of the ball.
- Why do these people like you guys so much? - It's not that they like us.
It's that they don't like you.
You know why? Uh, because you're an asshole! Is that true? Yeah, kind of.
Can I talk to you in back for a second? - What's up? - You know that girlJanell? I know her.
- Okay.
So what? - So I think I know how we can solve this whole gay mess.
Great.
How? We gotta start with Dennis.
Can you get him so drunk tonight? On tequila.
But a lot of it.
Enough that maybe he might hurt himself.
- Yeah, sure.
No problem.
- All right.
- Where are you going? - I gotta talk to a couple friends from my acting class.
But seriously blackout drunk.
All right.
Okay.
So you did the lime first, and then the shot, right? No.
No, no, no, no.
Dude.
- You take the salt - Take the salt.
And then you take the shot.
Okay.
- And then you suck on the lime.
Okay? - Okay.
Why don't you show me again.
'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.
- You lick it.
- Salt.
Lick it.
- And then you slam it.
- Yeah? Oh, that's great.
All right, so, I'm gonna do the shot first No, no, no, no Oh Oh, please, please, dude.
You're not listening to me.
Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.
- You do the salt first.
- The salt first.
- And then the lime.
- Show me again, because I'm not The salt first.
Then the lime.
Oh, God.
Hello.
Mmm.
Nice.
Beautiful.
Hello, lover.
Whoa! What the hell! What is going on here? Relax, stud.
You got nothing to be ashamed about.
What the f What does that mean? - Did we have - No.
No.
Don't be silly.
It was all hands.
How's that ass feelin'? I'm really glad you decided to embrace this.
- You're doing the right thing, bro.
- I think so too, dude.
- I feel really good about broadening my horizons.
- It's gonna be fun.
- It's a good business decision.
- Yeah! I don't want to own a gay bar anymore.
What, dude? Oh, no.
What happened? Just, uh I was doing some thinking and, you know We had our little experiment.
It was great.
But we should go back to normal.
Oh.
You had an experiment, and you want to go back to the way it was before the experiment.
- Interesting.
- The bar.
We had our experiment with the bar, and it was great.
Let's go back to normal.
You're done experimenting? Or are you gonna experiment some more? - What is this experimenting? - Hey, Dennis! What's up? Listen, I got you some new CDs.
'Cause the music you had in the jukebox was a little bit stale.
Also, we gotta get rid of these shamrocks.
'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks like Irish crap.
- Can we talk for a second in private? - Yeah.
No problem.
So, listen, Terrell, it's not really working out.
- We're gonna have to let you go.
- I thought you were happy.
No, we were happy.
But then Dennis had an experiment, and he wants to go back to normal.
Yeah, we had that experiment Why do you keep saying it like that? You guys are being ridiculous.
Yeah, we're being ridiculous! We're making a lot of money! - Yes! Thank you! - Look, everybody! Sweet Dee's here! - Hey, everybody! - Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing here? - Charlie? - What is going on here? You guys know each other? Yeah! That's the crazy bitch that punched me in my eye! Charlie! That's my sister.
Now, just to clarify, when you say ""sister,"" you mean I mean my sister.
Yes! Okay! This is great! Because earlier you were implying that I was racist because you thought that I was implying that all black people are related.
And then it turns out that you people actually are! No, that's not what I meant.
Hold on a second.
I meant that you two actually are.
Mac? Stop talkin'.
Hundred and 11, hundred and 12, hundred and 13 $114! - On a Saturday night! - We're back to normal.
We are back to normal.
Mmm.
Dee, I gotta know.
What, exactly, did you tell those guys from your acting class to do to Dennis? Oh, I forgot to tell you.
That didn't work out.
- What? - Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of those guys.
Then why was he so freaked out? How's that ass feelin'?",success

Code name Duchess.
Hm.
Known from Berlin to Bangkok as the world's most dangerous spy.
So for us, this is How you say? - A good get.
But not so good for you, Mr.
Archer.
Because you have information that I want.
And this may be old cliché but we have ways of making you talk.
What? Your little go-cart battery? - Golf cart.
- Whatever.
- Would you pick an accent and stick with it? - Listen here Son of a bitch.
- Now you did it.
- What is the point of these simulations - Krenshaw's arousal? if you don't take them seriously? How can I? Between his lame accent and the go-cart battery - Golf cart.
- Shut up.
And speaking of lame, my code name Was chosen at random by the ISIS computer.
Random? It was your dog's name.
Oh, Duchess.
I loved her so much.
That it was creepy and pathetic? And if you were half as smart as she was She wasn't too smart to die from eating chocolate, was she? Exercise terminated.
- All right, that's lunch then.
- Agent performance unsatisfactory.
Oh, come on At worst, that was ""needs improvement.
"" - Jesus, Archer.
- What? - You think this is a game? - No, I think Jenga is a game.
What if I'd been real KGB? I assume you'd try to suck a promotion out of some Russian guy's cock.
- Maybe I never get promoted - Never will.
because my mommy's not the boss.
And maybe you just got your face kicked off.
That is my foot in your face.

I'm so hungry.
Just give me five minutes on my backhand then we'll see if there's a - Is that a dog? Is it a dog? - Oui, that is Abelard.
Oh, adorable.
Now get the hell out of here.
But you promised me breakfast.
You want breakfast? Try the diner.
You're obviously into Greek.
Get it? Thank you, Abelard.
- It's a short list, Woodhouse.
Yes, sir.
- Things we don't allow in.
What are they? - Dogs and your mother.
- That's a very short list, isn't it? - Yes but you were quite insistent - What was I? that an exception be made.
No, no, no, because forget the dog rule, because this pug is amazing.
Watch this.
Abergard, go.
Do you not hear that? That's ""Puttin' on the Ritz,"" man.
- I'm always insistent, Woodhouse.
- Yes, sir.
- But I'm not to be trusted, am I? - No, sir.
Stop.
Shut up.
I have to go.
But if I find one single dog hair when I get back I'll rub sand in your dead little eyes.
Very good, sir.
- I also need you to go buy sand.
- Yes, sir.
I don't know if they grade it but Coarse.
One entire whole week we've been calling you.
Highly unprofessional.
Really? Because I find your sweatiness unprofessional.
So we have something in common.
Besides the fact that now both of our shirts reek of curry.
- And when will you settle your account? - When will you buy some dress shields? - This is not a dress.
- Are you serious? That's not a dress? Oh, God, with the curry again.
This shirt smells like Indira Gandhi's thong.

Archer I have H.

- Shut up.
Hey, Krieger, you gotta smell this.
Krieger? Huh.
You geeks wanna smell something? - Archer, get the hell out.
- What is it with you people? Try to include people in your life and then you Lana.
Hey.
Hey, what does this smell like? Like the dysfunctional asshole I broke up with six months ago.
Oh, my God.
You're amazing.
You are amazing, sweet stuff.
Wanna do it again and put on some interracial porn? God, it's like my brain's that tree, and you're those little cookie elves.
Just a second.

- I have to.
Sorry, it's Mother.
- Mother, hey.
Just a second.
- I cannot believe you.
No, turn it on.

- Is that Archer? - Goddamn it.
- Archer, hey.
- Go away.
- About your operations account - Not - Cyril, not now.
- Yes, now.
- Not a good time.
- You've got serious discrepancies in your account.

Heh.
Not you, giant African man.
I'm sorry.
Can I offer you a drink? How about this expensive prostitute? That is a very serious implication, Cyril.
Well, so is embezzlement.
Yeah? Well, so is the fact that you, some crazy-how, are screwing my ex.
- Archer, please.
That's private.
- Not calm enough? You all know about Cyril and Lana, right? Of course, because if Pam knows, then everybody knows because of Pam's huge mouth.
Right, Pam? H.

Mediations are supposed to be confidential, Pam, you manatee.
- And as for you, Cyril, good day, sir.
- Archer.
Hey, wait.
What about your account? Oh, I get it.
Classic misdirection.
No, don't.
You're so ugly when you cry.

- No.
No.
No.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
- No.
No.
And it makes for fascinating reading.
- No.
- Let's see.
You turned in an expense report from Berlin where the German desk says you never checked in.
- Oh, Berlin was - Ditto Buenos Aires.
- Too busy to check in? - There was Yeah.
Already off to Monaco? - I'm spying.
- Or was it Mallorca? Oh.
- Or Tunis? - Tunis kind of rings a bell.
ISIS isn't your own personal travel agency.
It doesn't exist just so you can jet off to Whore Island.
That's not a real place.
I have 50 agents who'd literally kill to move up to your position.
If you don't square your operations account by Monday they won't need to.
Your position will be vacant.
- Sterling.
- Hm? Sorry.
I was picturing Whore Island.
Have I made myself clear? Are you? You're looking for the answer ""yes""? - Yes.
Good.
- Then, yes.
Then get out.
And for God's sake, take a shower.
Smells like a whorehouse in here.
Okay.
Your own fingers.
- Hm? - Nothing.
Johnny Bench called.
So here's the thing.
I need to access my operations account and you're preventing that.
Now, we can do this easy or we can do it hard.
Your call.
No? Hard it is then.
- Oh, God, sorry.
Goddamn it, Archer.
- I forgot that Did I get you? What is wrong with you? Me? Nothing.
You, on the other hand, have a bullet inside you.
- I see the foot's all better.
- And I see you're still a hatchet-face prick.
- Do you see that sign? - Do you see that sign? - Well - That's why.
So we don't get ants.
Because when your co-workers put food in the refrigerator that's a bond of trust, okay? And if you violate that trust, or the food, there's There's my favorite section head.
I am dealing with the break room problem.
Oh, good.
You caught the Oh, wait I had something for this.
- The Pita Predator.
- You know what? Sorry.
Let's just call it what it is.
- Food rapist.
- Not a pretty name, is it? Pam, if you want some food that's supposed to be cream-filled I offer these delicious doughnuts.
Yeah? - In exchange for a favor.
- A favor? - Yeah.
After how you treated me? - **** your dolphin, Pam.
Archer, she's down, all right? - Your ******* dolphin.
She's tapping out.
- You.
- I think she peed.
I had to get three stitches.
And I broke my watch.
And I'm sorry for that.
- Three - But I need your help, Pam, because I'm um, conducting a mole hunt.
- Aah.
- Gasp you should because if you let me in the mainframe, I'll drop these doughnuts.
Then you can pretend they're marbles and you're a hungry, hungry hungry hippo.
Lana.
Hey, I know I'm supposed to be up my own ass right now but - Oh, is that what you want? Yup.
- Because that's how you get ants.
Yay.
Cyril, my favorite section head.
- What do you want? - To apologize for my behavior.
- Well - And also to - What are you doing? - Oh, just dicing veggies for dinner.
- I always make Lana stir-fry on Friday.
- Neat.
Listen - Guess what we call it.
- Stir Friday? - Wow, that's actually better.
- Yup.
It's all yours.
So come let me in the mainframe.
Is this about your operations account? - No.
Cyril - Yeah? I'm on a top-secret mole hunt.
Oh, yeah, Pam mentioned that.
- Wha? When? - Well, she called a minute ago.
- You know how Pam loves to gossip.
- Yeah.
I need rug marbles.
I know.
- Come let me into the mainframe.
- Okay.
- I need to confirm this with your mother.
- No.
No.
I mean, what? Cyril.
- What if she is the mole? Think about it.
- Your own mother.
Think what that would do to me if we had to kill her - Archer.
by stabbing her wrinkly neck with a knife? - Yeah.
I can't let you in there.
Can't or won't? - Either? - And after I gave you Stir Friday.
- That is much better.
- I know.
- But if you wanna access the mainframe - What? I guess you'd have to break in.
Break in to the ISIS mainframe.
Which is obviously ludicrous.
As is this baby corn.
What is that about? Archer? ISIS headquarters makes Fort Knox look like a gingerbread house.
Only two means of ingress.
The first, at street level.
Impenetrable after 6.
The second, through an access door on the roof.
Inexplicably unprotected.
But even if you zip-lined across reached the access door and somehow made it into ISIS headquarters you'd still have to find the mainframe.
But, wait, it gets worse.
Inside, there are three countermeasure systems.
The first is pressure sensitive in the floor.
Even a mouse triggers it.
The second is sound sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.
And the third system is state-of-the-art voice activation.
Cyril Figgis.
So, obviously, it would be a lot easier for me if you just disabled all that when you left work tonight somehow.
- Ooh.
That would make me uncomfortable.
- Yeah.
Oh, God, everything makes you uncomfortable.
Just the tip? Just the tip.
Just the tip.
How was I to know you're lactose intolerant? Because I kept screaming it.
- Well, what? - And this I'm just a secretary.
- I don't have access to security whatevers.
- What? - Then get them from Cyril.
- How would I do that? - Seduce him or Pam, or both.
- I can't do that.
- Can't or won't? - Either.
That's how you wanna play it? Fine.
- Are you gonna pay for your lunch? - Just the tip.
Actually, I don't have any cash.
Can you get it? Sorry.
I also need cab fare.
Oh, ugly duckling.
Bock, bock.
So thanks for nothing, Carol.
Now I have to break into ISIS headquarters in a $900 turtleneck.
And if it gets ruined I'm gonna make you drink heavy cream, you Carol.
Wow, that was actually pretty easy.
Thanks, new turtleneck.
Oh, and thank you, duffel bag.
Jesus, what else could go wrong? Exactly.
You're not Archer.
That's what's so great about you.
And the fact your mother died in a fire.
- What? - I said where are we on that stir-fry? Agent Kane.
What? Yes, confirmed.
Confirmed a naughty nellie's breaking our after-work phone rule.
- Cyril, there's been a break-in at ISIS.
- What? - Think it's the mole? - God, you and Pam - Pam's all right.
- Wow.
Okay.
I've got to go.
- But it's Stir Friday.
- Hurray.
- But if I'm not here - Yeah.
Because after three months of whatever it is we're doing it's weird that you can't leave me alone in your apartment.
- I know I have trust issues, all right? - But it's - It's Archer's fault I'm like this.
- Here we go.
- All of those years of lying and cheating.
- It's fine.
That thing with the mayonnaise.
- How messed up he is about his mother.
- Fine.
Do you know he called out her name once when we f? Fine! - And here we are.
All fine.
- Cyril, come on, hon, please? Now who's a naughty nellie? - Hello? Hi, who's this? Cyril Figgis.
I'm sorry.
Did you say Faggis? - Figgis.
Figgis.
- Who is it? Better not be Pam.
Not Faggis? - Figgis.
I was very clear.
Hi, I'm a huge fan of cock and my name is Cyril Figgis.
Holy shit.
Our security is atrocious.
Seriously, it's really bad.
Password.
Hm.
Password.
How about ""guest""? No way.
It can't be.
Jesus Christ, that is just Baby Town frolics.
Okay, operations account.
Just how deep in the red am I? Out of my mind.
Oh, no.
How? How did I spend that much money? Yeah, I know it's sexy, Woodhouse.
That's why I bought 10.
Now arrange those by color.
These are all black.
Oh, are they? Or are five in a dark black and five in a slightly darker black? And now I'm short a slightly darker black one.
So let's just put all my expenses into some pathetic idiot's account by the name of Oh, Krenshaw.
- Oh.
Now that's not very nice.
- Oh, God.
Hey, I was I was just talking about you.
And about how this isn't what it looks like.
- A lot of that going around.
- Yeah.
It's an epidemic.
For example, my real name is Kremenski.
- Is that sound? Is that Jewish? - It's Russian.
Um - Russian-Jewish? - I'm the mole, idiot.
What? I made up the mole.
Yes, but you told Pam and now everyone is looking for a real mole.
God, do we hate Pam.
- So I have to escape.
- And irony.
Thanks for breaking into the mainframe for me.
- Double irony.
- I'll need 50,000 for travel expenses.
- Fifty thousand? - From your account.
- That's too much.
- It's all last-minute bookings for two.
Wha? Oh.
Because when I hand the notorious Duchess to the KGB I won't just get a promotion, I'll get my own dacha.
- Too bad you'll never see it.
- What the? Lana, Krenshaw's a mole.
And his name's not really Krenshaw, it's Kremenski.
Definitely Russian, possibly a Jew.
I don't know.
Thoughts? Yeah.
Shut up.
And you, drop it.
- Or what? - No, no, no.
Do not wind her up.
That is a big gun, and she is baby crazy.
- Baby crazy? - That's why I dumped her.
- You little You sack of shit.
- What? What? I dumped you because you're dragging around a 35-year-old umbilical cord.
See? All you talk about is baby shit because you're baby crazy.
- You wanna see crazy? - No, I've seen that movie and spoiler alert, it ends with a closetful of my suits on fire.
- I wish you'd been wearing one.
- Who would want to wear an on-fire suit? - Cosplay enthusiasts.
- What? Do you even hear how totally batshit insane you sound? I'll tell you what I hear.
Yeah, please keep talking.
So why are you sitting here in the car eating stir-fry? Oh, it's Stir Friday.
And Lana said to.
Krenshaw? - Ms.
Archer? - What's this flap about a break-in? - Mother, look out.
Krenshaw is a mole.
Oh, Pam's just full of crap as she is of carbohydrates.
- Now Hey.
- Not this time, you impossible bitch.
Also, you should all be nicer to Pam.
- I am always nice to her.
- To her face.
- Why aren't you in the car? - Will somebody do something? What are you doing, you idiot? Shut up.
It's classic misdirection.
Looks like we've got a Mexican standoff, Kremenski.
How is this a Mexican standoff? - Dumb-ass.
I don't care if you shoot her.
- I do.
- But what if I shoot her, mama's boy? Sterling? - Yes.
- Picture her dead in the gutter - Sterling.
and what your pathetic life will be like without old Mommy dearest.
Jesus Christ.
What is it? - He's got an erection.
What? - What the hell is wrong with you people? Nothing.
You, on the other hand Ow.
Ow.
- An erection? - Ow.
Hey.
What's in there, buckles? The thought of me dead gives you an erection? No, just half of one.
The other half would have really missed you.
I mean, not - Oh.
- Ugh.
Johnny Bench called.
Yep.
See here, Krenshaw just stole 50,000 from Archer's account.
- Must have been doing it all along.
- Apology accepted, ass douche.
- What? Call him that again - Make me.
What? - Do you see this? - I just don't understand.
- This is a hostile work environment.
- I would have known if we had a mole.
- How? - How what, dear? - How could you know if we had a mole? - Um Then I am taking hot pepper and slowly I am rubbing it around Goddamn it.
Hello? Darling? - Who was this? - Who are you, Comrade Question? And who are you, Comrade Questions? - Comrade? - Oh, shut up.
You and your erection.
- And why are there doughnuts everywhere? - Lana did that.
Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants.",success

(clears throat) Laura, you are so kind.
Thank you.
You know, time is a time is a funny thing.
Um Sometimes time itself tells you that it's time to move on to other moments in time.
And when that time arrives, you can't really predict it, you can't explain it, you just have to obey the ticking clock that is destiny.
And I think that this is that time.
What? Another opportunity has knocked on my door.
So I respectfully decline.
I am so sorry.
Is it another firm? It's best if we don't talk about it.
Good-bye.
W-Wait a minute, just tell me.

Uh-huh.
You know, there's, uh a wine bar on Foothill - that has a killer Riesling.
- Uh-huh.
It's actually called Jimmy's House of Spirits.
Uh-huh.
It's like a liquor store and a wine bar.
Also, in the restaurant in the Hilton, they have, um, something called branzino.
You ever heard of branzino? Yes, I have.
- It's a fish.
- I know.
- Really? - Yeah.
Of course.
'Cause I thought it was a sandwich.
Well, anyway, I'm just I'm so excited to be here and chillax and just live that SoCal sunny lifestyle, you know? Well, we are two hours from the beach - Well, four in traffic.
- So I hear.
I feel like you and I are gonna have a lot in common.
And I'm not just talking about the pizza and the fie.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, you know what? Until my business cards come in, I'm gonna take a few of these, in case anyone asks what I'm doing in town.
And I can show them this and be like, ""I have a job.
It's legitimateâ"" (laughs nervously) Okay.
So this is the kitchen.

Hernandez? Oh, I'm sorry.
That's Mrs.
Hernandez.

I, uh love all the wolf imagery.
Yeah, I went to a swap meet in Gardena and got all this.
I keep the pelts at home because they shed a little bit.
Uh-huh.
- Okay - Look, I wasn't going to talk about this out there, because, well, I mean, you know how offices can be, you know.
It can be very gossipy.
But I'm in the middle of a divorce.
Right.
Yeah, you mentioned that.
And my wife, well, she's got a very powerful pit bull lawyer.
I mean, this guy's amazing.
One of those real smart Jewish guys.
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm I'm Jewish.
Really? Yeah, but it's okay.
I I honestly had no idea.
That is a tiny nose.
It's like a button.
Thank you.
Look (sighs) (crying): I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm in kind of a bind here.
(sobbing): Oh, geez.
Oh, I didn't want to do this.
Um (sobbing) Oh Um (sobbing) I like the wolf with the bandana.
That's my favorite, too.
I just can't lose her.
I can't lose her.
Darryl, uh You know, there's other fish in the sea.
Right? It's not healthy to keep fixating on one person.
The relationship's over I am not talking about my wife.
I am talking about my daughter.
My ex-wife is trying - to get Madison away from me.
- Huh? I want you to represent me in my case.
- Oh - No, you're right.
I'm sorry.
I This is so inappropriate.
Oh, Jiminy Christmas.
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Uh, look, Darryl, I'm very flattered that-that you asked me to represent you, but you know my specialty's real estate law.
I wouldn't be qualified I know, but I just want to see my wife's face.
I mean, her Jew went to CSU Long Beach.
My Jew? Harvard and Yale.
Mmm? Can I think about it? I will think about it, sincerely, because I see that you're a really good dad.
But you know, that's why I moved to West Covina, to be with families who care.
And I care, too.
And I promise that I will always be there for you.
(phone chimes) Hold on one second.
But right now, I got a thing.
I'm gonna go do this thing.
Doesn't mean that I don't care, I'm just gonna go do the thing.
I will come back later and let's circle back about the Jew thing.
'Cause that's a conversation that we need to have.
The Jew thing? Why did I say that? ANNOUNCER: curve-balling out about five to ten miles per hour.
Jerry Murdoch steps in against Patterson.
He hit two home runs in the second inning, but down three now, here in the bottom of the fifth.
Are you lost? The wine bar's over on Foothill.
I'm just here for some baseball.
Sounds good.
What can I get you? Beer, please.
Any kind.
You from around here? Never seen you before.
I actually just moved to town from New York.
Seriously? I love New York.
What-what brings you here? Work and, um I-I'm actually here because I'm meeting a friend.
But I don't I don't see him.
Great.
Maybe I know him.
Is he eight years old? Or an alcoholic? 'Cause that's what we've got here.
You're a good listener.
- Hmm? - Exactly.
You know, a buddy of mine just moved back from New York.
Guy I grew up with.
- Really? - Yeah.
But there's no way you know him, right? It's a big city.
I might.
What's his name? Josh Chan.
Oh, my God, are you kidding? That's crazy! I I know him! - Seriously? - Yeah.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
He was just here.
You just missed him.
That that's his beer.
Ah! Mmm! (laughs) Um, yeah.
Oh, mmm Um, it's actually such a funny s-story.
So, I was in New York, but I was looking to relocate to Los Angeles because I'm just, I'm a beach gal.
Uh, so I run into Chan and he tells me how great West Covina is.
And I'm like, okay, filing it away, filing it away.
But then, boom! That same day, I get this rando call from a one-eighth Chippewa who's very prominent in my field, asking me to start a position here.
Crazy, right? Wait.
So you left a job in New York to live near the beach? We're four hours from the beach.
People say two, but those people are dumb.
Yeah, but, like, you know, it's such a great place.
- I mean, the motto is ""Live, Work, Play.
â - We have a motto? - Yes, on the Web site.
- We have a Web site? It takes a few minutes to load, but it's very informative.
This is where I live.
Yay for me.
So, anyway, to go back to my, um, story.
- Please do.
- So I got here and I reached out to Josh, but he hasn't gotten back to me, so I don't if he-he dropped his phone in the toilet, 'cause I did that once and I was out of commission for hours.
So maybe he did that.
Do you know where he went, though? - 'Cause I'd love to, like - No.
No idea.
He said he was going out, but he didn't say where.
Okay.
Thanks.
But I, uh it's funny.
I do know where he's gonna be tomorrow night.
Yeah? Yeah.
This guy, Beans we call him that, he's Mexican That sounds racist, but he named himself that and he kind of makes us call him that; we don't want to.
His actual name's Bernard.
It doesn't matter.
Anyway, he's having a house party.
It should be a lot of fun and, um Josh is going.
And I'm going.
(exhales) Do you want to go? Yeah.
Is there, like, a Paperless Post that I should reply to? Why don't we why don't we just go together? Great, yeah.
Okay, so, um So you'll come to me, in a car? Yes, like a date.
Because you're pretty and you're smart and you're ignoring me, so you're obviously my type.
I'm sorry.
What were you saying? Perfect.
(sighs) A party.
Big party.
(singing to self) Ooh! (laughs) You were right behind me.
Yeah.
What's up? Uh, about the Ramirez case: The judge refused to grant the stay, so we present our arguments on Wednesday.
Well, that's swell, because I'm really good at arguing.
Oh! Before I forget to tell you, though, I do not like the judge in that case.
I want Judge Egan.
I did a little research.
So what I need you to do is petition the court.
We will get Judge Egan and we will crush that illegal water park.

""Not gonna come tonight"" His girlfriend's making him go to her sister's quinseÃ±era.
Sorry.
Um Josh has a girlfriend? Just 'cause Facebook says he's single.
Okay, I'm getting the Josh vibe again.
Maybe we should just go back to the party.
No, no, that's crazy.
Come-come here, crazy.
Like, if you must know, Josh isn't my type.
But, like, speaking of types, like, what type's his girlfriend? - I should go.

Um, like, where did he, where did he, where'd he meet his girlfriend? Like, what's their, what's their story? What's their deal? They dated in high school.
He moved back to be with her.
Oh.

It's like, it's like The Notebook.
(zipping) Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I, uh, - What? What? I can't believe I'm doing this, because I-I really I really need this, but, um, I don't know much, but what I do know is it's not good to hook up with a crying girl.
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not crying.
I'm not crying.
I'm fine.
No, you're not.

What are you doing here? You think you are so much better than me, huh? Harvard? Yale? I am just as smart as you are, Miss Snooty Shoes.
What are you talking about? I'm talking about Josh.
Chan.
Yeah.
Josh Ch Josh Chan! - Josh Chan! - Okay, hey, hey, hey! Hey.
- What do you know about Josh? - What do I know about Josh? Uh, let's see, um, I know he lives in town, which is weird, because you told you didn't know anyone here, and clearly, you know him, because you checked his Facebook 63 times today and his Instagram 18 times.
Have you been going through my computer? Yes, yes, I have.
I could have you fired.
Oh, you lied to me.
I wasn't lying to you.
I wasn't under oath when I met you in the office.
All right, you know what? Did someone shove a Bible under my hand? This is not the point.
The point is whoever this Josh Chan is, you are, you're obsessed with him.
(laughs) What? You love him, you moved here for him, and you won't admit it.
Why? Wow, okay.
I do not love him.
I barely know him.
I dated him for two months when I was 16 at a summer camp.
So you're saying that I moved here from New York and I left behind a job that would've paid me $545,000 a year for a guy who still skateboards? I did not do that.
Here's what happened.
I was in New York.
I ran into Josh.
He made me feel warm inside.
Like glitter was exploding inside me.
Then I moved here.
I did not move here because of Josh, because that would be crazy, and I am not crazy.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
No, I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy.
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
- Okay, no, stop it.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my God, I'm crazy.
- Stop it.
Listen.
- Oh, my God, I'm crazy.
No, no, no, no, I'm crazy.
Oh, my God, I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
You hear me, you're not crazy.
You're in love.
And that is, that is totally different.
No, I'm not in love.
That would be stupid.
Hey, wait, whoa.
- You're not stupid.
- That would make me stupid.
You just should've told me.
That's all.
I-I-I'm just, I was busting your balls 'cause you lied to me.
- Okay, no - No, no, no, no, no, I'm crazy.
I'm crazy.
- All right, this is going down a road - I'm crazy and I'm irrational - that I am not - and I'm everything my mother said I was.
Now stop it! Don't you talk about my friend like that ever again.
Do you hear me? We're friends? (chuckles) I would be proud to be your friend, now that I know the truth.
What you did for love, for true love, the sacrifices, the-the money that you walked away from - Oh, God.
- No, no, no, no, no.
No.
You're not crazy, and you're not stupid.
You know what you are? You're brave.
And I wish that I had been as brave when I was your age.
Okay, look, you want it to be a secret? I get it.
I will not tell a soul, okay? But-but I'm here now.
Okay, you are not in this alone.
And I will, I will help you.
Let me help you, 'cause we can win this thing! (whispering): We can win it.
We can (exhales) We can win the whole thing.
Okay? It doesn't matter, um because I just found out that Josh has a girlfriend.
- What? - No, it makes sense, because I texted him 46 hours ago and he hasn't gotten back to me, because he's busy with his girlfriend.
No, no, no.
His Facebook status says he's single, and if he was into her, why would it say that? That's what I said.
Exactly.
All right.
This is why you need me.
All right, look, if we play this right, one day, it is gonna hit him like a bag of nails to the balls, and that day, he will text.
(phone chimes) Are you a witch? I-I can't.
I think I might faint.
- Just, I can't, I can't, I can't.
- Okay, hold on, no, no, no.
- I can't - (gasps) - What? (gasps) - Josh Chan.
Oh, God, oh, God.

Hey, Denise.
It's me, Nipsey Hussle.
I recently had an eye-opening experience.
I'm calling to apologize for the way I treated you when you danced in my recent music video.
Denise, I'm sorry that I showered you with Cristal.
I didn't even ask if you liked Champagne, and it probably messed up your blow out.
Ashley, I realize now that it wasn't right for me to tell you what to do with that big fat butt.
You can wiggle it, or you could sit it down in a classroom and get that college degree in communications.
Chelsea, I'm sorry I put you in a bikini made of gold coins and then made you dance on the roof of my Bentley.
I realize now that metal conducts heat and that was probably a very uncomfortable experience.
Anyway, Denise, hit me up whenever you get this.
I'd love to discuss The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir, which I just read.
You are beautiful inside as well as out.
You are my equal.",success

You supposed to be so smart, you can't remember to flush? - That wasn't me.
- It was you.
I checked.
You better eat something real.
Instead of all them candies and cookies and whatever other stuff was in there.
Did you break it up with a stick? Alfred's at the Glenwood apartments.

Cookie? Thanks.
- So, Zoo Tycoon - You want in on Paper Boy.
What? - No.
- Please, man.
People ain't just nice, Earn.
When was the last time you were nice to a girl - you weren't trying to smash? - This morning.
You talking about your daughter, man, that's gross.
No, it'd be gross if I was trying to smash.
I don't want a handout, I want to manage you.
Manage? You know where the word ""manage"" come from? ""Manus,"" Latin for hand.
Probably, but I'm gonna say no for the purpose of my argument.
""Manage"" come from the word ""man,"" and, uh, that ain't really your lane.
- My lane? - Yeah, man, I need Malcolm.
You too Martin.
You know what they did to him? They killed him.
Didn't they kill Malcolm, too? Oh, no, they say that.
But ain't nobody seen the body since the funeral.
That's how funerals work.
Alfred, you already Malcolm, okay? You have that already.
What you really need is a silent wild card, somebody who's about the money, the opportunity, who can play both sides if needed.
Oh, like Don Lemon.
Fair point, let me rephrase what I'm trying to say.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
It's 4:30.
Oh, damn, man, we late.
- No.
- Since when? I'm doing business.
Hey, you want a manager a rapper, but you can't do business hot? VH1 is hiring interns.
And that sound like a joke, but they actually, they tweeted that this morning.
How's Princeton, by the way? Still on that year off? Three years is a long year off.
I guess.
- I think I know what happened.
- I really think you don't.
Look, man, is there somewhere we can talk for real? 'Cause I'm sorry, who is this dude? - Darius, man.
- Man, I'm fine with talking When you first walked in; I gave you cookie.
No, yeah, I remember who you are.
Look, I'm not asking for money.
You should be, ain't you homeless? Not real homeless.
I'm not using a rat as a phone or something.
Don't be racist, man.
That make you schizophrenic, that don't make you homeless.
Wait, wait, not if it worked, man.
No, if you could use a rat as a phone, man, that'd be genius.
I mean, there's like five rats for every one person in New York alone.
Everybody would have an affordable phone.
Yeah, man, I mean, it'd be messy, but worth it.
Is he your manager? [sarcastically.]
Rappers need managers.
I'm just trying to get paid right quick.
Yeah, man, rap is D-E-D.
Ded.
- [giggles.]
- This isn't about rap.
If we do this right, your kids can live good, my kids can live good, Darius's kids.
I can't have kids.
I'm sure I'll find out why when the time's right.
When is an appropriate time to talk about my balls getting smashed? Right now, apparently.
Look, I'm not dumb.
You're older, you have no real fan base.
You're not white and/or selling sex.
I sell sex, man.
- Hey, track 28.
- Yeah.
[smooth hip hop music.]
Oh! - Come on.
- Uh.
Hey mucking, mucking That's massage and Fucking, fucking - See, the concept is a massage - I got the concept.
Okay, 28 tracks? Lot of skits.
- I'd cut 'em.
- No, but his is different.
Yeah, mine are really good.
I'd still cut 'em.
Well, you not my manager, Earn.
I still know people at Diamond House.
Promoters.
People who manage big time artists now, man.
Oh, boy, you think you slick.
You coming in here, acting like you saving me, when really, I'm saving you again.
Nigga, I'm trying to help you.
Man, nigga, I ain't seen or heard from you since my mom's funeral.
And the first thing I hear out your mouth is ""let's get rich.
"" Walk, man.
What's up, dude? Earn? Yo, what's up, man? - Yo.
- Good.
Did you just come from that dumpster? No.
How are you? Oh, yo, I'm good, man.
I didn't know you were in town.
Uh, yeah, I've been low-key, man.
Yo, obviously oh, dude, if I knew you was in town, I would've hit you up with this party last night.
Yo, we needed a real DJ.
This dude well, he can't spin worth of shit, but then he goes and he plays Flo Rida.
- No! - Back to back.
So I calmly pull him aside, I was just like, ""Really, nigga?"" - You actually said that? - Yeah, man, I had to.
Cool.
You know that song ""Paper Boy""? Yeah, ""Paper Boy"" by Paper Boy.
Yeah, I've heard it.
Shit's fine.
Dude, the streets love it.
Y'all should play it.
Yeah, for real.
Yeah.
You guys should really play it.
Uh, I mean, KP picks all the music.
Well, slide it past him.
I mean, KP will usually spin some records for some scratch up top.
How much? - Half a stack.
- $500? Am I buying the station? Everything is who you know.
Then introduce me.
Yeah, I'm gonna introduce every dude in Atlanta with a mixtape in my box.
Come on.
I'm not every dude.
Uh, you kind of are.
Look, I don't have $500.
I make 5.
15, plus commission.
I got to pay rent tonight and my parents won't let me in the house.
It's like those drug commercials, only not funny.
Man, you know how niggas out here are.
I mean, he usually charges a full safe.
Then what's in it for you? Why am I so lucky? What's your cut? Oh, I'm not about that, I'm too busy, man.
I mean, it's just business.
You give me the money, I pass it on to KP.
But you know, it's probably for the best.
Music business is gross.
All right, man, well, you know, it was great seeing ya.
I'm taking over for Speedy tonight.
All right? Keep it locked.
What's up, my dudes? What's up, bro? Hey.
Hey.
That guy ever say nigger around you? Yeah, right.

- Say what? - Hey.
You got a weird wife, you know that, huh? Hey, um hey, look, I know you don't know me my name's Darius.
Um, I was just wondering, could I measure your tree? No, not right now.
Not right now? That basically means no, man.
Look, I got a question.
So Earn want to manage me.
- Really? - [chuckles.]
And I don't trust him, no offense.
- I understand.
- That's what's messed up.
I don't really think I know Earn anymore.
[hip-hop music.]
Like, what happened at Princeton? I never asked.
He'd tell you before me.
No.
Earn is good at keeping his mouth shut.

Earn trying like the rest of us.
But when he wants to do something, he does it.
On his terms.
[faint pop music.]
Your mind's racing.
Tell me, yo.
I just keep losing.
I mean some people just supposed to lose? For balance in the universe? I mean like, are there just some people on Earth who supposed to be here just to make it easier for the winners? Like, really.
Resistance is a symptom of the way things are.
Not the way things necessarily should be.
Actual victory belongs to things that simply do not see failure.
Let the path push you like a broken branch in a river's current.
No, no, I'm not going out like that, but thanks for the advice.

47,The Goldbergs,"Show me wax on, wax off.
Man, I loved the '80s.
It was the age of E.
T.
Mr.
T.
, and MTV.
Back then, the world was still small.
No cell phones or internet or twitter.
Your friends lived on your street, and your family were the people at your dinner table.
If you were assuming these smiley people were my family, they're not.
This is my family.
This is how I remember the '80s.
There were no parenting blogs, or peanut allergies; just a whole lotta crazy.
Ah, look at that little geek.
Yep, that's me, Adam Goldberg.
We were the first on our block to get a video camera, and I used it to record my entire childhood.
I'm home! The man parking his pants at the front door, that's my dad, Murray Goldberg.
TV's mine! Ever since his last heart attack, he became determined to exercise, eat better, - And not yell so much.
It wasn't working.
- Stop with the camera! My super-friendly sister Erica.
She loved to talk to people, just not us.
Adam, what the hell? I'm gonna crimp your face.
Mom! Barry Goldberg, textbook middle child, and classic over-reactor.
You're a liar, Simon! You are a liar! Stop videotaping! And finally, my overbearing ""Smother,"" Beverly Goldberg.
A homemaker, a ball breaker, who found the time to stay fit, raise the kids, and drive us all insane.
Yeah, we were the family that yelled and cursed, but to this day, we still love each other.
This is my family September 3, 1985.
It began as a typical morning in the Goldberg house.
You don't know anything.
He's not too old for me.
He's in college, Erica! Wrong.
He dropped out to start a band.
Don't you feel stupid now? Mom, they don't zip.
Can you help me with this? Oh, look at you.
Oh, why go shopping when your sister's jeans fit you so perfectly? Fit me perfectly? They're horrible.
They're roomy in the hips and tight in the front.
I look like Brooke shields.
And she's beautiful.
Look, you need to be grateful, because one day, I won't be here to help dress you.
You keep sayin' that, but when? As always, my mom began the day by dressing us, feeding us, and ignoring any sense of human boundaries.
Where's my baby? Happy birthday.
What do you want for breakfast? - Privacy! - Oh, please.
Don't forget to wash your bottom.
Barry was in a rare good mood.
He was turning 16, a day he'd been waiting for his whole life.
It's jingling.
It's keys.
Keys means car, car means freedom from all you monsters.
I love you, mom.
What the hell is this? It's a locket.
It's got my picture inside so you can always have your mother near your heart.
Sweetie, you're just not ready to drive.
You're too immature, and quite honestly, a little high-Strung.
I am not high-Strung! I'm strung just fine, like a tennis racket or a banjo- You know, I think it's great, 'cause all the cool guys in my grade, - They have mom lockets.
- Hey! - All of 'em.
- don't poke the bear, all right? You don't wanna wear it, fine.
- I'll throw it in the trash.
- Go ahead.
- Here I go.
- do it.
- Go ahead.
- Gonna go in the garbage.
Unbelievable.
You were gonna let me throw this in the trash.
Totally irresponsible.
You're not driving.
Oh, god.
Dad, please talk some sense into your wife.
She saying some pretty Controversial things over there.
I agree with Whatever nonsense your mother just said.
Come on, this is not fair.
Who the hell told you life was fair, ya moron? Dad's colorful way of speaking may seem a bit harsh; it really wasn't.
You just had to learn how to speak Murray.
It's 2:00 A.
M.
I thought you were dead.
I could kill you.
You broke it.
It's amazing.
You little bastards ruin everything.
For someone so smart, you sure act like an idiot.
All right, stop your pouting.
I got you something, and I think you're gonna like it.
Reo speedwagon? This is top 40! You don't know me at all.
I'm into rap, the poetry of the streets.
Come on! No, no, I talked to the guy at Sam Goody.
He said it was a hip track.
Well, did you talk to Sam Goody himself? Huh? Did you? No.
You talked to a random jag-off who knows nothing about real music.
You weren't there, okay? The guy had an earring, he had a Jean jacket, covered in buttons.
Covered! Don't get your father all worked up.
I'm already all worked up.
- Honey - Calm down, breathe.
I'm breathin', okay? You're killing your father.
I hope you're having a happy birthday.
Barry had one last visitor, my grandfather, pops, who was 80 years of pure awesome.
I hear someone turned Holy crap! For me? I don't love you that much.
This baby's mine.
You get my old one.
- Yes! - No! I didn't get a car when I turned 16.
What do you need a car for? With your looks, you can get a ride from any boy in town.
Here you go.
It was the moment Barry had Waited for his whole life.
Those keys meant freedom, and no man could stop him.
But my mom could.
Not gonna happen, Dad.
We've decided Barry can't drive.
What?! so Barry has a car and no license, and I have a license and no car.
That makes no sense.
You know what else makes no sense? Those Peach wine coolers I found hiding in your closet.
Yeah, I'm everywhere.
This is the Worst birthday ever.
The only one who understands me is flavor flav.
Who runs like that? Are we havin' a drag race? What's with the bird car? My father thinks he's Burt Reynolds.
The sexiest man alive? Yes, I do.
Hey, kiddo, pick you up after school? Um, we're goin' to the ""Y"" To do some water aerobics.
It's good for his circulation.
Swimming was just our cover.
Pops really took me to the house of waffles to teach me the finer things in life.
And you can't just go in and honk 'em.
It's all about the cuppage.
Be gentle.
Those puppies are sensitive.
I just wanna bury my face in 'em.
We all do, but you gotta earn it.
Speaking of, where are we on operation waffle girl? Her name was Zoe Mcintosh.
She was the complete package.
Beautiful, older, and her dad was our family podiatrist.
Okay, last week, we told her your name.
Let's see if it stuck.
Oh, miss, could you top me off? No, no, pops.
Too bossy.
Pops, stop.
We can't do this.
I'm not ready.
Whassup, girl? The check, please.
You got it, Allen.
Did you hear that? She just called me Allen.
That's not your name.
I'll change it.
I'm Allen now.
Pops, you're a genius.
Thank you, jedi master.
You're not making this easy, kid.
Sorry.
You're like my own personal obi Wan kenobi, but instead of the force, you're teaching me how to get freaky.
- Who's elbow cannoli? - Is that Barry? Barry, what are you doing? Eating day-Old doughnuts.
My friend Terrence, he's the manager.
- He leaves 'em out back for me.
- Why? It's called eating your feelings, ass bag.
Mom's gonna walk me to the bus till I'm 40, all right? Put down the garbage cruller.
I'm gonna figure out a way to get you that license, and my car.
Come on.
Really? As we cruised in Pops' new ride, we felt like kings.
It didn't matter that my mom said Barry couldn't drive.
Our grandfather would fix that.
He was always cooking up a plan in that brilliant mind of his.
All right, pops, you said you had a plan.
Whatcha thinkin'? Pops, you okay? Okay, his mind wasn't what it used to be, but his appetite still was.
So who wants nuggets? Pops was booked with reckless endangerment, we were all thrown behind bars.
That is, until our mom arrived.
Are you proud of yourself, locking up an old man and two little boys? God help the poor soul that tried to push us around.
That was her job.
Memorize this face, because it is going to haunt your dreams, sir.
It is gonna haunt your dreams.
Are you guys okay? No, I'm not okay.
Barry took a dump in front of us.
I had to go.
It was bad.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault.
The next morning, mom lowered the boom, and took pops' keys.
I'm not one of your kids, Bev.
You can't boss me around.
I do the bossing.
Dad, I'm just trying to help you.
Your mind is not what it used to be.
As always, the neighbors came out to watch.
Oh, hello, Gina.
Why don't you take a picture? It'll last longer.
For the record, Gina, that's my mom's best friend.
Can I go now? I've got a date with Shirley Nagle.
She's got 12 grandkids, so you know she puts out.
Cut the crap, Albert.
Okay? Cut it! It's all life.
You lose your keys, Barry gets some keys.
It's the circle of driving.
Looks like I better get on home and take this all in.
- Can I have the keys? - No.
- You're out of my will.
- You're out of my will.
That's right.
We'll see who croaks first.
Wait, wait.
Does this mean I can drive? - Yes.
- No! Hon, I said Barry was not ready, and you agreed.
In my defense, I wasn't listening.
Whenever my dad disagreed with my mom, this would happen five minutes later.
Who watches Adam sleep In case his asthma kicks in? Me.
She'd guilt him into submission.
Who bought the family a new hamster because you sat on herbie? Me! But not this time.
My dad always had a soft spot for Barry, so he decided to help the kid.
all the dirty work that you don't wanna do.
Bevvy, you live for those things.
Now that the kids are growing older, your whole world is falling apart.
My world is fine, thank you very much.
Okay, if you got no problem letting go, then I'm gonna take Barry for a driving lesson.
You two stuck in the same car together? That'll go well.
Good luck not flipping out.
I don't need luck.
I'm gonna teach him good.
I'm gonna parent the fiiiiiep out of him.
Barry, daddy's gonna teach you how to drive.
Seriously? Uh-huh.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Yeah, that's right.
- Barry's driving.
- Unreal.
I raised a moron.
My dad was determined to do the impossible.
Not yell.
Stop screaming, please.
Okay, the brakes.
You're riding the brakes.
You gotta put your foot on the gas some time.
You go so slow.
- Let him pass.
- Who? The guy on the moped.
Let him pass.
- Let him pass.
- Go ahead.
Okay.
Now, we're going to make a right.
Before we get to the right, turn on your signal.
Not the wipers.
It's just smearing everything around.
- Oh, my god! - You gotta let me out of this car, man.
- I can't die before I cop a feel.
- Shut up, okay? You wanna die, I'll kill you right now.
Hey, both of you.
Do not hit the child in the back.
That's way too advanced.
- Too advanced.
- Turn off the wipers, - Make a ""U,"" We're goin' home.
- Home? No, no.
This is my one chance to get my license, and I'm getting it, all right? You blew it.
Stop the car.
What are you doing? Go around.
My son's a moron.
Go around.
Go! He's a moron.
Get out, I'm takin' the wheel.
No, you said it was my turn.
Circle of driving.
- Open up.
- No.
- Open up.
- No! - Open up.
- No! No, no, no, no.
Well, you can't stay in there forever.
Forever, no, but 20 minutes, absolutely.
Barry, the cop just said he's gonna tow the car.
- Well, I would, too.
- God! And then, things went from bad to worse.
My mom arrived.
Who called her? I'll give you a hint.
It was me.
Barry, open up.
Get out! Get out now! Get out, get out! Let me in, let me in.
You're not gonna get punished.
Come on, we'll go for pizza.
You wanna go for pizza? Ice cream? Let me in! Let me in! So this is what happens when you're in charge, huh? City-Wide traffic jam.
Whose world is falling apart now? - Move the car! - Shut up! Albert, these kids adore you.
Talk to the boy.
Absolutely.
Fight the power, Barry.
You can drive.
It's a god-Given right.
In that moment, my dad expected my mom to go nuclear.
But then, she did something even worse.
This is your mess, you clean it up.
She left him in charge of Barry.
I regret nothing! In all the chaos, pops and I were able to sneak out to work on operation waffle girl.
Welcome back, boys.
What'll it be? I don't know.
What do you think, Allen? Let's pull the trigger.
Two Monte cristos, all the trimmings.
- Ahem.
All that fried meat and cheese? - Mom?! - You're gonna be on the bowl for hours.
- Mom, leave now.
Go.
I'll come back.
I see what's going on.
Someone has a crush.
So adorable.
Not gonna happen.
- Excuse me? - Here we go.
Well, I have to draw the line somewhere.
Erica's rushing off to college, Barry wants to drive, and now, you want a date? You still play with toy robots.
They're gobots, and one day, - They'll be worth millions.
- They weren't.
Baby, you're not ready for girls.
You don't even have pit hair.
- I have three.
- I didn't.
Dad, how could you encourage this? 'Cause he's in sixth grade.
Loosen your damn grip, Bev.
Yeah, I'm a man now, a man with needs, and I need Zoe and her sweet, delicate boobs, and you can't stop me.
You're out of my will! Whatever that means.
This is your fault, you know.
If I knew that's why you drove him here, I never would've allowed it.
You wanna know why I won't give up my license, Bev? You wanna get with Shirley Nagle.
Yes, we get it.
Shirley Nagle.
Are you kidding me? I got that locked down, but if you take away my car, you take away my time with my grandson.
Getting waffles with that little guy, it's the best part of my week.
Oh, dad.
I didn't know that.
You'll make it right, Bev.
I know you will.
If my mom realized she had to let go, dad decided it was time to get more involved.
I guess you were right, okay? It looks like I'll never drive.
Any dummy can learn to drive, even a dummy like you.
Come on, dad.
You got me an reo speedwagon tape.
You don't know anything about me.
Trust me, I do.
I know you go through life feeling all angry, let down, misunderstood.
I get it.
Wow.
That's Yeah.
Do you ever cry into your Pillow? No, I don't cry into my pillow.
Who cries in their pillow? Not me.
I don't.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna talk to your mom, and tell her that she's gotta let you get your driver's license.
- Really? - Yes.
Thank you, and can you also convince her to get a hobby? Knitting, break dancing, anything besides us.
Yes, I'm working on it, kid.
Turns out, our dad did have a good heart after all.
He just had to open it up once in a while.
You know what? I don't say it a lot, but you're not a total moron all the time.
Can I drive? No! Oh, come on.
Not REO Speedwagon.
Hey, this is good stuff.
Okay? I've been listening to it.
What started out as friendship's gettin' stronger come on.
have the strength to let it show here we go.
Join me.
I can't stop this feeling Anymore I've forgotten what I started fighting for Look at you! It's time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars forever 'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore I've forgotten what I started fighting for what are you, uh, doing? Nothing.
Those the kids' baby blankets? You got me.
Sometimes I smell 'em when I feel sad.
That's not weird, is it? Well, a little weird.
Yeah, my world is caving in.
I've given those kids everything, and now that they're growing up, and don't need me as much, what do I have? Me.
I'm not goin' anywhere.
All right, let me have a sniff.
And I can't fight this feeling anymore I've forgotten what I started fighting for it's time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars forever 'Cause I can't fight this feeling Forget about the diner.
They just opened this place, I think you may like it.
I've forgotten what I started fighting for it's time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars forever 'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore and with that, the circle of driving was finally complete.
I've forgotten what I started fighting for and if I have to crawl upon the floor come crushing through your door I raised a moron.
Classic.
You're aggravating me, you little bastard! He's aggravating me, the little bastard.
The sexiest man alive? Yes, I do.
But I'm drinkin' tonight.
Don't forget to wash your bottom.
I don't believe you.
You're really a jackass.
Stop videotaping! Get out! Mom Stop! I swear Good-Bye.",success
48,Friends,"The One Where It All Began (Pilot) There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.
You're going out with the guy.
There has to be something wrong with him.
All right, Joey.
Be nice.
So does he have a hump and a hairpiece? Wait, does he eat chalk? I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl.
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
I'm in high school, in the cafeteria.
.
and I realize I'm totally naked.
I've had that dream.
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone.
.
there.
- Instead of - That's right! Never had that one.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
What do I do? Everyone starts looking at me.
They weren't looking at you before? Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.
And it turns out it's my mother.
Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
Hi.
He says, ""Hello,"" I want to kill myself.
You okay? I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth.
.
- and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today.
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.
No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.
- Just leave my aura alone, okay? - Fine, be murky.
- I'll be fine.
I hope she'll be happy.
- No, you don't.
No, I don't.
To hell with her.
She left me! You never knew she was a lesbian? No! Okay? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know.
How should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
Did I say that out loud? I told Mom and Dad last night.
They took it pretty well.
Oh, really? So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing.
.
""I'll never have grandchildren,"" was what? A wrong number? Sorry.
Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
You're angry.
You're hurting.
Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joints! Hey, you're single.
Have some hormones.
But I don't want to be single, okay? I just want to be married again.
And I just want a million dollars! - Rachel? - Oh, Monica! Thank God! I went to your building.

and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are.
- Can I get you some coffee? - Decaf.
Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor.
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe.
.
Joey.
Remember my brother, Ross? Sure! You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
I was in the room with all the presents.
.
and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
When all of a sudden Sweet 'N Low? I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.
I got freaked out, and it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr.
Potato Head.
I always knew he looked familiar, but.
.
I had to get out of there, and I started wondering.
.
""Why am I doing this,"" and ""Who am I doing it for?"" I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart.
.
but you're the only person I know here.
- Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
- I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.
I guess he bought her the pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
""Tuna or egg salad! Decide!"" ""I'll have whatever Christina's having.
"" Daddy, I just I can't marry him.
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.
Well, it matters to me! ""If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
"" She should not be wearing those pants.
Push her down the stairs! Push her! Push her down the stairs! Come on, Daddy, listen! All my life, everyone's always told me, ""You're a shoe!"" ""You're a shoe!"" What if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a purse? Or a hat? No, I don't want you to buy me a hat! It's a metaphor, Daddy! You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look, Daddy, it's my life.
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision.
Maybe I don't need your money.
Wait! I said maybe! Just breathe.
That's it.
Try to think of nice, calm things.
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens La la la something And noodles with string I'm all better now.
I helped.
This is probably for the best.

He's away a lot.
Stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day.
Like there's a rule, or something? I got it.
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.
It's Paul.
Oh, God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in.
- Who's Paul? - Paul, the wine guy? Maybe.
Your ""not a real date"" is with Paul, the wine guy? - He finally asked you out? - Yes! It's a ""Dear Diary"" moment.
- Rach, I can cancel.
- Please, go, I'll be fine.
Ross, are you okay? Do you want me to stay? That'd be good.
- Really?- Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy! Does he sell it, drink it? Or he just complains a lot? Hi, come in! Paul, this is.

Everybody, this is Paul.
- The wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name.
Paul? I'll be right back.
I've just gotta go A-wandering? Change.
Sit down.
Two seconds.
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.
She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot.

Shut up, Joey! What are you up to tonight? I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon.

We're very excited about it.

But I'm just going to hang out here.

I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things.
.
using a bunch of these little worm guys.
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever.
.
and I cannot feel my legs.
- We got a bookcase.
- It's beautiful.
What's this? I would have to say that is an L-shaped bracket.
- Which goes where? - I have no idea.
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.
This was Carol's favorite beer.
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.
- Start with that, we're out of here.
- Please don't spoil all this fun.
Let me ask you.
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.
What did you get? - You guys.
- You got screwed.
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
I'm such an idiot.
I should've known when she went to the dentist five times a week.
I mean, how clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that.
How did you get over it? He might accidentally break something valuable of hers.
- Say her - Leg? That's one way of doing it.
I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch? The worst I ever did was shred my old boyfriend's favorite towel.
- Steer clear of you.
- That's right.
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.
It's about me.
And I just The machine cut me off again.
Anyway.

I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs.
Barry Finkel.
But it isn't me.
It's not me.
Not that I have any idea who ""me"" is right now, but you just I'm divorced.
- I'm only 26, and I'm divorced! - Shut up! That only took me an hour.
We haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than a Mento.
You have had the love of a woman for four years.
Four years of closeness and sharing, after which she ripped your heart out.
That is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point! Know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody? I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.
What are you talking about? One woman.
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream.
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.
Rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.
You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.
It's the best thing to happen to you! You got married.
You were like, what, 8? Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon! - I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
- Then stay out of my freezer.
Ever since she walked out on me.
.
What? You wanna spell it out with noodles? It's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.
So there's going to be a fifth date? Isn't there? Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.
What were you going to say? Ever since she left me.
.
I haven't been able to perform.
.
sexually.
Oh, God! I'm so sorry.
Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
How long? - Two years.
- Wow.
I'm glad you smashed her watch.
So you still think you might want that fifth date? Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham.

But I gotta go.
I got a date with Andrea.
Angela.
No, Andrea.
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

Here's the thing.
Even if I could get it together enough.
.
to ask a woman out.
.
who am I going to ask? Isn't this amazing? I've never made coffee in my life.
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.
If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
I think it's, ""If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do.
"" If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something.
.
Although, actually I'm really not that hungry.
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi.
Paul, is it? - Thank you so much.
- Stop.
Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations.
.
plus the barn-raising scene in Witness.
We'll talk later.
Thank you.
That wasn't a real date.
What the hell do you do on a real date? Shut up and put my table back.
I've got to get to work.
If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.
So, like, you guys all have jobs? Yeah, we all have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.
- Yeah, I'm an actor.
- Have I seen you in anything? I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.
Unless you saw the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.
.
at the little theater in the park? It was a job! ""Look, Geppetto.
I'm a real live boy.
"" - I will not take this abuse.
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy You should both know that he's a dead man.
Oh, Chandler! How are you doing today? Sleep okay? Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
I see that.
You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
I know.
He's just so.
.
- Remember you and Tony Demarco? - Oh, yeah.
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.
- Wow, are you in trouble! - Big time! Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.
I'm going to get up, go to work, and not think about him all day.
Or else I'm going to get up and go to work.
- Wish me luck! - What for? I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
- Hi, Monica.
- Franny, welcome back.
- How was Florida? - You had sex, didn't you? - How do you do that? - I hate you.
I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.
So, who? You know Paul? Paul, the wine guy? Yeah, I know Paul.
You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul? What? I take credit for Paul.
Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Of course it was a line.
Why would anybody do something like that? I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than: ""To get you into bed.
"" I hate men.
Don't hate.
You don't want to put that out into the universe.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs.
.
and men with emotional problems can hear? Come here.
Give me your feet.
I just thought he was nice, you know? I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.
- Guess what? - You got a job? Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing.
- I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
- You're surprisingly upbeat.
You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale.
.
How well you know me.
They're my ""I don't need a job.
.
I've got great boots"" boots.
- How did you pay? - Credit card.
And who pays for that? My father.
Is this really necessary? I can stop charging any time.
You can't live off your parents.
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own.
Thank you.
I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14.
Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail.
I didn't know anybody here.
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields.
And then he killed himself.
Then I found aromatherapy.
So I know exactly how you feel.
The word you're looking for is: ""Anyway.
.
"" - You ready? - No, how can I be ready? ""Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute?"" - I can't do this.
- I know you can.
- No.
- You made coffee, you can do anything.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut.
You know what? I think we can leave it at that.
- Kind of a symbolic gesture.
- Rachel, that was a library card.
If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Welcome to the real world! It sucks.
You're gonna love it.
That's it.
Are you going to crash on the couch? - No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay? Look what I just found on the floor.

- Split it? You probably didn't know this, but in high school.
.
I had a major crush on you.
I knew.
You did? I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.
I did.
Listen, do you think.

Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime? Yeah.
Maybe.
Okay.
Okay, maybe I will.
- Good night.
- Good night.
See you.
Wait, wait.

- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Can't believe what I'm hearing - What? I said - What? I said - Would you stop? - Was I doing it again? Yes! I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.
- You won't know a butt if it bit you.
- There's an image.
Would anybody like more coffee? You made it, or you're serving it? - I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

The dating world is not a fun world.
It's a pressure world.
It's a world of tension, it's a world of pain.
And if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready because she needs things.
Women need equipment.
I don't know what they need.
I know I don't have it, I know that.
You You know what they need? Women seem to need a lot of cotton balls.
This is one Always been one of the most amazing things to me.
I have no cotton balls.
We're all human beings.
I have no cotton balls.
We're all human beings.
What is the story? I've never had one, I never bought one, I never needed one.
I've never been in a situation where I thought to myself, ""I could use a cotton ball right now.
"" ""I could certainly get out of this mess.
"" Women need them.
And they don't need one or two.
They need thousands of them.
They need bags.
They're like peat moss bags.
Have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out.
They're gone.
The bag is empty.
Where are the cotton balls, ladies? What are you doing with them? The only time I ever see them is in the bottom of your little wastebasket.
There's two or three that look like they've been through some horrible experience.
Tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them.
I once went out with a girl, she left a little Ziploc Baggie of cotton balls at my house.
I didn't know what to do.
I put them on the kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds.
I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure, ""This is a dead town.
Let's move on.
"" The dating world is a world of pressure.
Let's face it, a date is a job interview that lasts all night.
a date is a job interview that lasts all night.
The only difference between a date and job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it.
You know, ""Well, Bill, ""the boss thinks you're the man for the position ""Why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be working with?"" Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking? Psh.
What a world that would be if you could just ask a woman what she's thinking.
You know, instead I'm like a detective.
I gotta pick up clues.
I'm like a detective.
I gotta pick up clues.
The whole thing's a murder investigation.
All right, listen, listen.
Don't get worked up.
because you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
.
Really, how? Because it's all in the greeting.
All right.
If she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.
Right.
You know, anything in In the lip area is good.
Lip area.
You know, a hug, definitely good.
Hug is definitely good.
Sure.
Although, what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are 8 feet apart? Those are brutal.
I hate that.
You know how they do that? Also, a shake is bad.
Shake is bad.
But what if it's the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top.
The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top.
The warm look in the eyes.
Hand sandwich.
Right.
Right.
Well, that's open to interpretation because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes Guess who.
Hey, hey.
He Hey! Hey! Hey.
Hey.
It's good to see you.
Hi.
This is my friend George.
Oh, hi.
Nice to meet you.

Let's get the bags.
Oh, yeah, sure, the bags.
Here, Laura.
I'm sorry.
Oh, thank you.
Boy, that was an interesting greeting.
Did you notice that, George? Yes, the ""surprise blindfold"" greeting.
That wasn't in the manual.
So what do you think? Whoa.
Wow.
This place isn't so bad.
Yeah, it kind of motivates me to work on the road.
So make yourself at home.
So, uh can I get you anything? Uh Bread, water salad dressing? Actually, um, do you have any wine? Uh, yeah, I think I do.
Oh, do you mind if I turn this down? Uh, no.
Yeah, go Go right ahead.
Yeah.
Jerry, I was wondering would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too? Uh, yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, why don't you stay? Yeah.
Um What is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you doing anything? Are you doing anything? Oh.
No, I'd love to do something.
I have my seminar in the morning, but after that I'm wide open.
Really? What would you like to do? Well Now, I know this sounds touristy, but I'd love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan.
Yeah, we could do that.
Why not? Why not? I'm just I'm really glad you're here.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Yes, she is.
Hold on.
Um, it's for you.
Oh.
Uh Hello? Oh, hi.
No, no.
It was great, right on time.
No, I-I'm gonna stay here tomorrow.
Yes.
Yes, it's fine.
No, we're going on a boat ride.
Don't be silly.
I'm not gonna have this conversation.
I'm not gonna have this conversation.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay.
Bye.
Never get engaged.
You're engaged? You know, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it.
I'm on this emotional roller coaster.
You're engaged? You know, I can't believe it myself sometimes.
You You have to start thinking in terms of ""we.
"" It's a very stressful situation.
You're engaged.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's a great guy.
Yeah.
You'd really like him.
You'd really like him.
I can't wait to get on that boat.
Me too.
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking.
I don't get it, okay? I-I-I admit, I'm not getting the signals.
I am not getting it.
Women, they're so subtle.
Their little Everything they do is subtle.
Men are not subtle.
We are obvious.
Women know what men want, men know what men want.
What do we want? We want women.
That's it.
It's the only thing we know for sure.
It really is.
We want women.
How do we get them? Oh, we don't know about that.
We don't know.
The next step after that, we have no idea.
This is why you see men honking car horns, yelling from construction sites.
These are the best ideas we've had so far.
The car horn honk.
Is that the beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car.
The woman walks by the front of the car.
The woman walks by the front of the car.
He honks the This man is out of ideas.
How does the? ""I don't think she likes me.
"" The amazing thing is that we still get women, don't we? Men I mean, men are with women.
You see men with women.
How are men getting women? Many people wonder.
Let me tell you a little bit about our organization.
Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now.
Now, he may not be our best man Okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene.
That's why I think men get frustrated when we see women reading articles like ""Where to Meet Men.
"" We're here.
We are everywhere.
We're honking our horns to serve you better.",success

And I love Christmas so much.
D'oh! All right, children, let me have those letters.
I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole.
Oh, please.
There's only one fat guy that brings us presents, and his name ain't Santa.
Uh-- A pony? Oh, Lisa, you've asked for that for the last three years, and I keep telling you Santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh.
Can't you take a hint? But I really want a pony, - and I've been really good this year.
- Oh, dear.
Maybe Bart is a little more realistic.
- A tattoo? - A what? Yeah! They're cool, and they last the rest of your life.
you will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas.
Yeah.
If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your allowance.
- All right! - Homer! - ""Yello.
"" - Marge, please.
- Who's this? May I please speak to Marge? - This is her sister, isn't it? - Is Marge there? - Who shall I say is calling? - Marge, please.
It's your sister.
Oh! - Hello.
- Hello, Marge.
It's Patty.
Selma and I couldn't be more excited about seeing our sister Christmas Eve.
Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit too.
Somehow I doubt that Homer is excited.
of all the men you could've married, I don't know why you picked one who's always so rude to us.
- Good one, Dad.
Okay, kids, prepare to be dazzled.
Marge, turn on the juice! - What do you think, kids? - Nice try, Dad.
Just hold your horses, son.
Hey, Simpson! - What is it, Flanders? - Do you think this looks okay? Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
- Oh! - Oh, neato! It's too bright.
I oughta-- Flanders.
What a big show-off.
- Kids, wanna go Christmas shopping? - I do! - All right! The mall! - Go get your money.
Tell us, Marge.
Where have you been hiding the Christmas money? Oh, I have my secrets.
Turn around.
- you can look now.
- Ooh! Big jar this year.
Oh, Bart, that's so sweet.
It's the best present a mother could get, and it makes you look so dangerous.
- One "" Mother,"" please.
Wait a minute.
How old are you? - Twenty-one, sir.
- Get in the chair.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Attention, all personnel, please keep working during the following announcement.
And now our boss and friend Mr.
Burns.
Hello.
I'm proud to announce that we've been able to increase safety here at the plant without increasing the cost to the consumer or affecting management payraises.
However, for you semiskilled workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses.
- Oh, and one more thing.
Merry Christmas! - Oh, thank God for the big jar.
- Where's that Bart? But, Mom, I thought you'd like it.
Yes, Mrs.
Simpson, we can remove your son's tattoo.
It's a simple routine involving lasers.
- Cool! - However, it is rather expensive, and we must insist on a cash payment up front.
- Cash? - Mm-hmm.
Thank God for Homer's Christmas bonus.
- Ay, caramba! - Now, whatever you do, don't squirm.
you don't wanna get this sucker near your eye or your groin.
- Ow! Quit it.
Ow! Quit it.
Ow! Quit it.
- Ow! Quit it.
- Hey, what's with this? Ow! Quit it! Used to be a real boss tattoo.
Mom had to spend the Christmas money having it surgically removed.
Huh? It's true! The jar is empty! Oh, my God! We're ruined.
Christmas is canceled.
No presents for anyone! Don't worry, Homer.
We'll just have to stretch your Christmas bonus - even further this year.
- Homer? - Oh, yeah.
My Christmas bonus.
How silly of me.
This'll be the best Christmas yet.
The best any family ever had.
Hohoho.
Hohoho.
Hohoho.
Ho ho ho.
Hohoho.
Hmm.
I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, Homer.
- Huh? Oh.
I love you, Marge.
- you tell me that all the time.
Oh, good, because I do love you.
I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping.
I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus.
I keep asking for it, but-- Marge, um, let me be honest with you.
- Yes? - Well, I would-- I-- I wanna do the Christmas shopping this year.
Uh, sure, okay.
Marge, Marge.
Hmm.
Let'ssee.
Ooh, look! Pantyhose.
Practical and alluring.
A six-pack.
Oh! Only 4.
99.
Ooh! Pads of paper.
I bet Bart can think of a million things to do with these.
That just leaves little Maggie.
Oh, look! A little squeak toy.
It says it's for dogs, but she can't read.
Ow! Oh, Simpson, it's you.
- Hello, Flanders.
- Oh, my! What a mess we've got here.
Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine? - Well, let's see.
- Oh, this one's mine.
This one's mine.
- This one's mine, and this-- - They're all yours! - Hey, you dropped your pork chop.
- Gimme that! - Well, happy holidays, Simpson.
- Gee, this is the best Christmas ever.
- You bet.
What's the matter, Homer? Somebody leave a lump of coal in your stocking? You've been sitting there, sucking on a beer all day long.
- So? - So, it's Christmas.
- Thanks, Moe.
Drinks all around! What's with the crazy getup, Barn? I got me a part-timejob working as a Santa down at the mall.
Wow! Can I do that? I don't know.
They're pretty selective.
Do you like children? What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts? - Hmm.
- Uh, I certainly do.
Welcome aboard, Simpson.
Pending your successful completion of our training program, that is.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
- What is it now, Simpson? - Uh, when do we get paid? Not a dime till Christmas Eve! Now, from the top.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
Um, Dasher.
- Dancer.
- Mm-hmm.
- Prancer.
- Mm-hmm.
Nixon.
Comet and Cupid.
- Donna Dixon? - Sit down, Simpson.
And what would you like, little boy? - You're not really Santa, tubby.
- Why, you little egghead! No, Homer! If such an emergency arises, you just tell them Santa's vey busy this time of year, - and you are one of his helpers.
- Oh, I knew that one too! Homer, why are you seven hours late? Not a word, Marge.
I'm heading straight for the tub.
But, Homer, my sisters are here.
- Don't you wanna say hello? - Daddy! We're so glad to see you! - Oh, Dad, you're finally home! What? Why? Oh, yeah.
Hello, Patty.
Hello, Selma.
- How was your trip? - Fine.
- you both look well.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.
- It's Christmas? - you wouldn't know it around here.
- And why is that? - For one thing, there's no tree - I was just on my way out to get one! - Can we go too, Dad? - Yeah, can we? No! Sleighbells ring Are you listening In the lane Snow is glistening A beautiful sight We're happy tonight - Walking in a winter wonderland Hey! What do you think you're doin'? - Uh-oh.
- Hey! Hey! - Come back here! So what do you think, kids? Beauty, isn't it? - Wow! Yay, Dad! - Way to go, Dad! - Why is there a birdhouse in it? - Uh, that's an ornament.
Do I smell gunpowder? and then I want some Robotoids.
And then I want a Goop Monster.
And then I want a great big, giant-- Aw, son, you don't need all that junk.
I'm sure you've already got something much more important-- a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you.
Hey, I couldn't afford lunch.
Give me a bite of that donut.
Get a load of that quote-unquote Santa.
I can't believe those kids are falling for it.
Hey, Milhouse, I dare you to sit on his lap.
- I dare you to yank his beard off.
- Ah, touche.
I hope you feel better, Santa.
Oh, I will when Mrs.
Claus' sisters get outta town.
Thanks for listenin', kid.
Hey, Santa, what's shakin', man? What's your name, Bart ner? Uh, little partner? - I'm Bart Simpson.
Who are you? - I'm jolly Old St.
Nick.
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.
D'oh! - Homer! - A word with you in Santa's workshop.
- Cover for me, Elfie.
- I didn't know it was you.
Nobody knows.
It's a secret.
I didn't get my bonus this year.
But to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, - I'd do anything.
- I'll say, Dad.
you must really love us to sink so low.
Now, let's not get mushy, son.
I still have a job to do.
Hey, little ones.
Santa's back.
Ho ho-- D'oh! Damn it to-- Ah, son, one day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday.
Receiving a big fat check for a job well done.
Simpson, Homer? Here ya go.
Come on, son.
Let's go cash this baby and get presents for-- Thirteen bucks? Hey, wait a minute.
That's right.
$120 gross.
Less Social Security, less unemployment insurance, - less Santa training - Santa training? less costume purchase, less beard rental, less Christmas club.
- But-- But-- - See ya next year.
- Ohh! - Come on, Dad.
Let's go home.
Thirteen bucks? you can't get anything for 13 bucks.
Allright! Thirteen bigones! Springfield Downs, here I come! - What? - you heard me.
I'm goin' to the dog track.
I got a hot little puppy in the fourth race.
- Wanna come? - Sory, Barney.
I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to a sleazy dog track on Christmas Eve.
Come on, Simpson.
The dog's name is Whirlwind.
Ten-to-one shot.
Money in the bank.
- Uh-uh.
- Ah, come on, Dad.
This can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas.
If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas.
It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs and it's gonna happen to us.
Well, okay, let's go.
Who's Tiny Tim? Hey, Moldy, do you think Santa will be able to find ElfCounty under all this snow? I doubt it, Bubbles.
We'll be sad little elves this Christmas.
- Oh, no! - Oh, brother.
- Where's your husband? - Yeah.
It's getting late.
Said he went caroling with Bart.
We're in the money, we're in the money We got a lot of what it takes to get along I can't believe I'm doing this.
Can we open our presents now, Dad? you know the tradition, son.
Not till the eighth race.
Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind? Number Six.
That's our lucky dog right over there.
He's won his last five races.
What? That scrawny little bag of bones? Come on, Dad.
They're all scrawny little bags of bones.
Yeah, you're right.
I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas.
Attention, racing fans, we have a late scratch in the fourth race.
Number 8, Sir Galahad will be replaced by Santa's Little Helper.
Once again, Sir Galahad has been replaced by Santa's Little Helper.
Bart, did you hear that? What a name! Santa's Little Helper! - It's a sign! It's an omen! - It's a coincidence, Dad.
- What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper? - Ninety-nine to one.
Wow! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals Merry Christmas! I got a bad feeling about this.
- Don't you believe in me, son? - Uh-- Come on, boy.
Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going.
Oh, go for it, Dad.
That's my boy! Eveything on Santa's Little Helper.
Three cheers for Brainy! - Hip hip hooray! - Yay! Unadulterated pap.
It's almost 9:00.
Where's Homer anyway? It's so typical of the big doof us to spoil it all.
- What, Aunt Patty? - Oh, nothing, dear.
I'm just trashing your father.
Well, I wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact he has the same frailties as all human belings.
he's the only father I have.
Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships.
So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me, and I'm far too young to defend myself against such onslaughts.
Mm-hmm.
Go watch your cartoon show, dear.
Come on, Bart.
Kiss the ticket for good luck, not that we need it.
Here comes Screwy the mechanical rabbit.
- and they're off! - Come on, Santa's Little Helper! - Come on, dog! Go, man, go! It's Whirlwind in the lane, and coming up on the left is Quadruped, followed by Dog O'War and Fido.
- Go! Come on, boy! - Go! Come on, get that rabbit! Dog O'War coming up fast on the outside.
- Come on, Santa's Little Helper! - Come on, dog! Go, man, go! And with a lock on last place, it's Santa's Little Helper.
- Don't worry, Dad.
Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens.
- Come on, you stupid dog! Come on! - Go, go! - Run! Run! - Run, run! Come on, get that rabbit! - Go, go, Santa's Little Helper! Run! - Go, go, go! Whirlwind by a countrymile, second, ChewMyShoe, followed by Dog O'War.
Oh, jeez! Doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.
I don't wanna leave till our dog finishes.
Ah, forget it.
Let's go.
- Find any winners, son? - Sory, Dad.
Hey, hey, Simpson! What'dl tell you? Whirlwind! Let's go, Daria.
Beat it! Scram! Get lost! - you came in last for the last time! Look, Dad, it's Santa's Little Helper.
And don't come back! Oh, no, you don't! No, no! Get away from me! Uh-uh! Oh, can we keep him, Dad, please? But he's a loser! He's pathetic! He's-- A Simpson.
Hmm.
Maybe I should call the police.
- Oh, he'll sober up.
- Yeah.
Come staggering home.
Mm-hmm.
Smelling of cheap perfume.
- Homer! - What? What the-- Who the-- - Look, eveybody, - I have a confession to make.
- This should be good.
I didn't get my Christmas bonus.
I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for eveybody, but no matter what I did-- - Hey, eveybody, lookwhat we got! A dog! All right, Dad! - God bless him.
- So love at first sight is possible.
And if he runs away, he'll be easy to catch.
Oh, this is the best gift of all, Homer! - It is? - Yes.
Something to share our love and frighten prowlers.
- What's his name? - Number 8-- I mean, Santa's Little Helper.
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer Had a very shiny nose And if you ever saw it - you would even say it glows - Like a light bulb! -Bart! - All of the other reindeer Used to laugh and call him names - Like Shnozzola! -Lisa! They never let poor Rudolph - Join in any reindeergames -Like strippoker! -I'm warning you two! - Then one foggy Christmas Eve - Santa came to say - Take it, Homer! Uh, Rudolph get your nose over here - So you can guide my sleigh today - Oh, Homer.
Then all the reindeer loved him and they shouted out with glee Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer You'll go down in history -Like Attila the Hu-- - You little-- Shh.",success
